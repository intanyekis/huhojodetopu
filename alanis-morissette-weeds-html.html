She has worked on many projects, from theaters and TV series to films and documentaries.&nbsp;</p><p>Arguably, one of the best projects Morissette has worked on is Weeds. The show is a dark comedy-drama that aired from&nbsp;August 8, 2005, to September 16, 2012, on Showtime.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>As the name of the show suggests, Weeds revolves around a single mother, Nancy Botwin (Mary-Louise Parker), who sells marijuana to support her children after the death of her husband. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>Morissette played&nbsp;the role of&nbsp;obstetrician Dr. Audra Kitson for eight episodes spread across the fifth and sixth seasons.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span> <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong id=docs-internal-guid-e8d45a1f-7fff-676c-d747-f73be64e4b1f>Alanis Morissette.

It was made after the cliffhanger season four finale, which&nbsp;showed&nbsp;Botwin's pregnancy.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>She got pregnant by Esteban (Demian Bichir), the mayor of Tijuana. Now that Botwin was pregnant, she needed an&nbsp;obstetrician.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Therefore, Morissette signed on to that role. It was reported that she would guest star as&nbsp;Dr. Kitson for at least seven episodes in the fifth season.&nbsp;</p><p>Alongside being a doctor for Botwin, Morissette's character would also be a love interest for Andy (Justin Kirk), Botwin's brother-in-law.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">IGN reported</a>&nbsp;the singer was the second biggest casting for Weeds. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p></p><p><strong id=docs-internal-guid-310fd43f-7fff-c5eb-42f3-38f5718eeb6c>Alanis Morissette on Alter Ego.

She gushed about the series and how she got to star in it in a 2009 interview with <a href=# rel="follow noopener">The Star</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The singer watched the show "pretty religiously" when she was on her tour. She watched it at the back of her bus while going through "a cleanse."</p><p>She confessed that since she was changing her lifestyle through cleansing,&nbsp;the show helped her go through it. As a result, she was drawn into the show and loved it.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p></p><p><strong id=docs-internal-guid-78580c8b-7fff-fc1d-c2ad-94a412e49207>Alanis Morissette in a recording studio.

She did the same with Curb Your Enthusiasm and Sex in the City.&nbsp;</p><p>Coming back to Weeds, Morissette said that she was oriented on the spot on the set. Therefore, there was a gynecologist who guided her about how things work.&nbsp;</p><p>The real-life doctor taught her how to be a fake one on-screen from the start since the singer's first scene was Botwin's gynecological exam. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-176 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>It&nbsp;was awkward since she had never done it before.&nbsp;However, with the help of the gynecologist, Morissette performed phenomenally.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJmclruqv4ympquho6iytcDEZq6enZSoe6nAzKU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
