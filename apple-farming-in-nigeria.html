I don’t need to say it; the places apples don’t grow is far more than the places it grows so you need to make the right choice in terms of selecting a site for your apple plantation.</p><p>One of the things that most places lacks in Nigeria to grow this fruit is the is the temperature; Apples strive only in cold environment and that is why they are a temperate plant. They grow at a very low temperature.</p><p>An apple plant requires a temperature of less than 7C for at least 6 weeks during the rainy season. This is why it grow in only places like the Jos Plateau. The ideal soil for an apple to grow is loamy soil with a pH of between 5.5 to 6.5.</p><p>Also note that Bell apples require adequate humidity and rainfall to thrive. It can tolerate different soil types from sandy to clay. It can also thrive in moderately acidic soil.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=step-2-planting-and-post-planting-activities></span> Step 2: Planting And Post Planting Activities<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Bell apples are planted usually in January/December and requires rainfall of 115-120cm per year. During flooding, the excess water should be drained out quickly to prevent water-logging.</p><p>However, in the case of heavy rainfall, there’s no need for irrigation. The frequency of irrigation increases to 4 times a month during the summer and reduces to once a month during winter.</p><p>The seeds would need light to germinate. You have to press them gently into the soil with a space of 1 inch apart. Water the seeds and wait for about 3 weeks before it would start to germinate.</p><p>You can start selling the seedling 10 weeks after planting. Bell apple seedlings is also on demand because there few farmers in the country planting this kind of apple.</p><p>Also, training and pruning of the tree is needed. Pests can be controlled using pest resistant root stock. An apple orchard starts producing fruits at the 7th or 8th years and continues until it is about 35 years though some exceed this years.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=step-3-harvesting></span> Step 3: Harvesting<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Normally, before the tree start producing fruits, it usually take three years. Each harvest should yield you at least 1000 fruits with a minimum of 2 harvests within a year.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=conclusion></span> Conclusion<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>There is a growing demand for apples in Nigeria and you can harness this opportunity to make yourself some money. If you don’t have enough time, money, space or patience, you try planting the tropical apple such as the Bell Apple, it grows in 34 out of the 36 states of the country.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJmgpbmmecWaqaahnpx6qrqMp6CgnaKernA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
