The judge sentenced Blue, real name Jonathan Jamall Porter, to a suspended sentence of 24-60 months for the crime.</p><p>A suspended sentence does not translate to prison time, at least not yet. It serves as a legal arrangement in which a person who has been found guilty of a crime is not yet sentenced to prison. However, the accused will be ordered to serve the suspended sentence if he or she commits another crime during a specified period or breaks the judge's mandate.</p><p>He was also sentenced to probation not to exceed three years.</p><p>In Blueface's case, the judge said he can't be seen around anyone with a firearm. The judge stated the rapper is "playing with his liberty" if he surrounds himself with guns. He is also not allowed to attend any strip clubs in the downtown Las Vegas area.</p><p>"He can only be in those areas if he has work applications or any legitimate basis to be there, not as a pastime," the judge said.</p><p>Blueface is prohibited from interacting with the victim of the shooting or his family. He must stay away from drinking and smoking during the extent of his probation as well.</p><p>The shooting victim—Kentabius Traylor—told the judge at Blueface's sentencing that he was disappointed with the outcome.</p><p>"I know people who get more time for stealing bubblegum," Traylor said. "I'm just completely disappointed in all of this."</p><p>Traylor also took time to take a selfie in court with Blueface in the background.</p><h3>Blueface's Attorney Releases Statement About Sentencing</h3><p>Blueface's attorney, Kristina Wildeveld, has released the following statement to XXL about the outcome of the case.</p><p>"This morning Mr. Porter was sentenced to probation not to exceed three years and he has the ability to earn a reduction to a gross misdemeanor charge upon successful completion of his probation," Wildeveld said. "He is ultimately just looking forward to getting back to focusing on his music career and moving forward with his life."</p><h4>Read More: <a href=#>Blueface Shous Out Chrisean Rock's Sister, Chrisean Responds</a></h4><h3>Blueface Shooting at Man&nbsp;Started After a Joke Is Made About the Rapper</h3><p>The shooting occurred when Blueface was at the Euphoric Gentlemen’s Club in Las Vegas on Oct. 8, 2022. The victim had apparently joked about Blueface chatting with "some females in a cheap vehicle," per legal documents obtained by&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener>TMZ</a>.</p><p>The L.A. rapper didn’t like the joke, and members of his entourage allegedly hit the man "multiple times." The man later returned to the club in his truck. Security footage captured Blueface&nbsp;pulling out his gun and firing shots at the vehicle&nbsp;as the man drove away. The man was left with a bullet graze on his left hand and a truck riddled with bullet marks, according to police.</p><p><a href=#>Blueface was arrested</a> for the shooting in November of 2022.&nbsp;He&nbsp;<a href=#>pleaded guilty</a>&nbsp;to one felony count of discharging a firearm into an occupied vehicle and one misdemeanor battery charge on July 3 this past summer.</p><h4>Read More: <a href=#>Chrisean Rock Reacts to Rumor Her Son Has Fetal Alcohol Syndrome</a></h4><p>Watch Blueface receive a suspended sentence of up to five years in prison below.</p><h3>Watch Blueface Get Sentenced</h3><p><h2 class=photogallery-title>See Why These 22 Rappers Are in Jail or Prison Right Now</h2></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7ucTLppigZpOkunCuy66cn5mTmnq0sc2tnKeblZl6ra3SZq2en5GoerS0zqiroqaXZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
