She was brilliant and beautiful and I feel like a light has been taken away. To say she was an angel would be at the top of the list. She was the sweetest person you’d ever meet and had a huge heart. She loved her fans, and I don’t think she realized how much she meant to them,” Mike Pingel, Roberts’ representative told The Hollywood Reporter.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Dawn Wells, Mary Ann on Gilligan's Island, Passes Away At 82" href=#>Dawn Wells, Mary Ann on Gilligan's Island, Passes Away At 82</a></span></p><p>Born in 1955 in the Bronx, New York City, Roberts was the second child of a father of Irish descent and a Jewish mother.
