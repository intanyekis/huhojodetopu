A court has decided the singer is responsible for her father Jamie Spears’ legal fees, amounting to $2 million, after years of battling in court.</p><p>Representatives for the singer and her father officially confirmed earlier this week that they had reached a resolution in the legal dispute filed in December 2021, which alleged financial impropriety.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/britney-spears-2.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Britney Spears Faces Financial Crisis As Debt Continues To Pile Amid Divorce</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Britney reportedly blew through the $12.5 million advance she got for her memoir, published in October.</span><p>The settlement, undisclosed in amount, was finalized in Los Angeles Superior Court earlier this week. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to TMZ sources,</a> the settlement surpassed $2 million, despite initial claims from Britney's lawyer suggesting Jamie Spears had withdrawn $6 million from her estate.</p><p>Britney’s attorney Mathew Rosengart reportedly assured Britney of the strength of her case, accusing her father of financial mismanagement and covert surveillance. Though the settlement may not have met their expectations, it spares both parties from the trial that was set to start next month.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Her wish for freedom is now truly complete,” Rosengart said in a statement, referring to the conservatorship that held Britney between 2008 to 2022. “Her freedom now includes that she will no longer need to attend or be involved with court or entangled with legal proceedings in this matter.”</p><p>Britney’s latest legal challenge isn’t the only big expense. She’s also navigating her ongoing divorce from Sam Asghari, who filed to end their marriage in August after only 14 months.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/screen-shot-2023-11-15-at-8-49-53-pm.png> Britney Spears at the MTV Awards&nbsp; <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not only does she have legal bills from the divorce, but Sam is <a href=#>reportedly trying to get a more generous divorce settlement that</a> their prenup allows him to. Reports say he’s threatening to release the singer’s private information if she doesn’t comply, though Asghari has denied the claims.</p><p>While the divorce is being negotiated, Spears has allegedly been paying for Asghari’s apartment, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">which may be as high as $10,000 per month</a>.</p><p>Spears has a net worth of $60 million, but it’s allegedly supposed to be much higher. Her fortune was depleted during her conservatorship, but it looks like it’s going to get even smaller, now that the court decided she needs to pay her dad’s legal fees.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmm6qZqbumxYysp56Zoqh6sa3YZpuanKNif265yKWjoqeeYrmms8ClZJ%2Bdlah6pbXVqKmcnV2srqix0mamp2c%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
