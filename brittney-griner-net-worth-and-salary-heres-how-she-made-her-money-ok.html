As such, she has bagged numerous endorsement deals, which add to her net worth. In 2013, she signed a $1 million ambassadorial deal with Nike, an American multinational company that designs, produces, and sells athletic equipment, footwear, clothes, and accessories. This made her the first openly gay athlete to bag a deal with the company. In line with the endorsement deal, she is to model men’s clothes for the brand and skateboard.</p><h3><strong>Brittney Griner Risks Losing Money From Her Ordeal In Russia</strong></h3><p>On February 17, 2022, Brittney was arrested at Sheremetyevo airport near Moscow when she entered the country to play for the UMMC Ekaterinburg. She was nabbed for being in possession of hash oil (cannabis oil) cartridges as discovered by airport security officials. Reports have it that the Russian Federal Customs Service stated that a sniffer dog led them to conduct a search on the center player.</p><p>They opened a criminal case for large-scale drug transportation, a charge that could result in up to 10 years in prison. They further released a video of the WNBA player passing with a trolley suitcase and backpack. It was followed by footage of someone checking the package from the suitcase.</p><p>On March 5, the news of her detention was made public. On May 3, 2022, the US State Department stated that she was wrongfully detained and would do its best to ensure that she is released. This made her family, fans, and teammates to start campaigning for her release, urging the US government to do its best to set her free.</p><p>On July 1st, 2022, she was tried for the first time and upon her second trial on the 7th of the same month, she pleaded guilty. She further stated that the act was not intentional as she was in a hurry while packing her bags. Brittney went on to say that she would like to give her testimony but needed time to prepare. On July 4, she sent a letter to the White House, pleading for her freedom.</p><p>Speculations have it that she might be swapped with the Russian gun dealer named Viktor Bout detained in America. However, her case was adjourned to July 17th. With the enmity between America and Russia, her case might not be a smooth one. She might lose money if she finally faces a jail sentence as her playing career will come to a pause.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZ60qcDLoqWeZpOkunCu0aKrraaVrnqovsinnKtlnprBbsPOq6uhZZGjsW6%2FwKWYq7FdnbKzsdJmn6ivXai1pnnMmpueZZiav265zqecsmWfoHw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
