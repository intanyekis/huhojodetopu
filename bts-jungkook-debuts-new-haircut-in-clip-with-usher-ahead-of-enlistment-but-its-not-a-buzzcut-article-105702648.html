However, it is not a buzzcut!</p><p><h3>Jungkook debuts new hairstyle</h3>Just a day after dropping the Standing Next to You remix featuring Usher, Jungkook posted a video with the famed singer via Tiktok. Grooving to Usher's hit track Yeah, the duo showed off their impressive dance moves. However, rather than JK's dance moves, it was it his new haircut that caught fans' attention. While one might think its a buzzcut considering he's about to enlist, his hairstyle is actually quite sleek. Chopping of his luscious locks, the BTS star sported an undercut.</p><p><h3>RM, Jimin, V and Jungkook begin enlistment process</h3>On November 22 this year, BIGHIT MUSIC had released a statement regarding RM, Jimin, V and Jungkook's military enlistment process. Sharing that the maknae line had initiated the military enlistment process, the label wrote, "The artists are preparing to fulfill their military service duties. We will inform you of further updates in due course. We ask you for your continued love and support for RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook until they complete their military service and safely return. Our company will spare no effort in providing support for our artists."</p><p><h3>Jungkook's professional life</h3>In July 2023, Jungkook made his solo debut with the digital single Seven. After that, the BTS star released 3D featuring Jack Harlow and Too Much with The Kid Laroi and Central Cee. The singer finally dropped his first solo album, Golden, on November 3.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbXMnqqnp6ejsri%2FjZympmeVo8GmvtOaoKellaPBbrrEsKpoo5%2BnsqK6jpurrGWaqruot86oomaclZfCtb%2BMp5ywZZiWtrOv1K1koqZdmLmqvIywoK2gXarAqbHRZpihnZGZerCyjJ6lpaGjqbqmutNmma6sXZ7BtHnNqKtmmV2XwrvGwq6rZpmiqbakuMRmaGltZ2V%2Fd4CX</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
