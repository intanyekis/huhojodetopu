It's just a few days in but everyone is already starting to play an individual game to ensure their safety.</p><p>Despite trying to cut a deal with HOH <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miesha Tate</a>, we saw <a href=# rel>Teddi Mellencamp</a> be the first guest to be evicted from the house after being backdoored. This essentially leaves Miesha and her athletes alliance as the strongest alliance at the moment. The elimination of Teddi also means that the original and first alliance consisting of Carson Kressley, Cynthia Bailey, and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Todrick Hall</a> hardly has power with Todrick also supporting Miesha. Read on to know what fans thought of his betrayal.</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">'Celebrity Big Brother': Lamar Odom makes a WILD confession about 'sh*****g in bed'</a></p><p><a href=# rel>Todrick Hall crushes on Miesha Tate, 'Celebrity Big Brother' fans 'fully here for it'</a></p><p>After the elimination saw Teddi gone, Carson and Cynthia got together to share the sadness of their friend going. Cynthia was shocked and hurt by the fact that Todrick voted for Teddi despite them being a team. Knowing that he looked bad due to his action he decided to do damage control and went as far as telling Cynthia that he never wanted to work with Teddi despite being all chummy at the start. Stating in private that the power the HOH holds is important and that he did what's best for his game, Todrick continued his alliance with Miesha.</p><p>Cynthia too was taken aback by what he said and realized that he cannot be trusted. After being betrayed she expressed worry as this just left her and Carson together now that Shanna Moakler went over as well, after cutting a deal with Miesha to stay safe. Fans who tuned in were happy that Cynthia realized he is a traitor. They took to Twitter to express their feelings on his shady behavior, this is what they had to say.&nbsp;</p><p>A fan said, "Todrick cheering for everyone. He’s such a suck up #cbb3 #cbbus3", while another commented, "Glad everyone is seeing Toaddick for the snake he is #cbb #cbbus #cbb3 #cbbus3 #bbceleb #bbceleb3". A fan tweeted, "@todrick you are a fucking snake you’re going to say to Cynthia that you never wanted to work with Teddi!? In my opinion Teddi is the strongest one in the house so if you were playing right Teddi would’ve kept you! No you want to be stupid and dumb and go with Miesha #Teddi #cbb3".</p><p>A viewer said, "RT if you think Cynthia should not trust Todrick! #CBBUS3 #CBB #cbb3 #CBBUS #BBLF #BBCeleb #ICTV #myiclicktv". Another user commented, "YUP LOOKS LIKE CYNTHIA AND CARSON BOTH REALIZE TODRICK IS A TRAITOR! LET THE GAMES BEGIN! @CBSBigBrother #CBB3". A tweet also read, "Please don’t invite Toaddick back for Celebrity Big Brother All Stars. #CBB #CBBUS #CBB3 #cbbus3 #bbceleb #bbceleb3".</p><p dir=ltr lang=en><a href=#>@todrick</a> you are a fucking snake you’re going to say to Cynthia that you never wanted to work with Teddi!?
