Cyrus.</p><p>In the song “Agora Hills,” she hints at marriage by singing: “Kissin’ and hope they caught us/ Whether they like or not/ I wanna show you off/ I wanna show you off/ I wanna brag about it/ I wanna tie the knot/ I wanna show you off.”</p><p class=p1><span class=s1><p>AD LOADING...</p></span></p><p>The 27-year-old drops another hint later in the song by saying:&nbsp;“Take you ’round the world, they don’t have to understand/ Rub it in their face, put a rock on her hand.”</p><p>On the very next track “Can’t Wait,” Doja Cat continues to wax poetic about her relationship by rapping:&nbsp;“I wouldn’t do this for no man/ It’s a understatement if I tell you you’s important/ I’m just tryna bring you drinks and assortments/ Hot towels with a mocktail by the ocean/ Top down with our ice shinin’ like a snowman/ Cook you a crab boil that reminds you of New Orleans.”</p><p class=p1><span class=s1><p>AD LOADING...</p></span></p><p>And later:&nbsp;“Just know that I will wait or that I’d never leave/ I’m givin’ you space, givin’ you cover, uh-huh/ Givin’ you true love in abundance, uh-huh/ Givin’ and takin’ because we’re not a fling/ Givin’ me faith that it’s not another.”</p><p>While Doja doesn’t mention J. Cyrus by name, the comedian hails from New Orleans, so her reference to The Big Easy suggests that she is indeed talking about him — and that things are getting pretty serious between them.</p><p>The pair have been dating for almost a year after&nbsp;<a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>first being spotted kissing and spending time with each other in November 2022</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mibqKKRYrCiwIydnK%2BhnGK9orXNraCnnw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
