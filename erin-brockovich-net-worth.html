The film was directed by <a href=#>Steven Soderbergh</a> and written by Susannah Grant. It was a dramatization of the true story of Brockovich's fight against PG&E regarding its culpability in the Hinkley groundwater contamination incident. Receiving five Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Actress - which Roberts won. Brockovich herself had a small cameo early in the film, as a waitress named Julia. The film grossed $28.1 million on its opening weekend and went on to make $126.6 million in North America and $130.7 million in the rest of the world. Brockovich claims the movie is 98% accurate, with some details changed for creative reasons.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Erin_Brockovich_29594008324_cropped.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The case came about while Brockovich was a legal clerk without any legal, scientific, or medical qualifications. Locals asked Brockovich to help them, and she pushed for the case to go to court. The case was settled in 1996 for $333 million, the largest settlement ever paid in a direct-action lawsuit in United States history. The law firm for which Erin Brockovich was a legal clerk, Masry & Vititoe, received $133.6 million of the settlement, and Brockovich herself walked away with $2 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With the&nbsp;settlement, Brockovich could move out of a cockroach-infested house and into a mansion in Agoura Hills, San Fernando, Los Angeles. The dramatic change in lifestyle came at a price though, with her teenage children ending up in rehabilitation clinics later, due to habits they acquired after the settlement. Of the $2 million, it's <a href=#>reported</a>&nbsp;Brockovich had to pay $1 million in taxes and $250,000 in rehab fees. Brockovich still lives in the Agoura Hills mansion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Born Erin Pattee in Lawrence, Kansas, she's the daughter of Cindy - a journalist - and Frank Pattee, an industrial engineer and football player.
