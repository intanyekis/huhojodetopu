The “Pull Up” artist was <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234748831>initially indicted</a> by a federal grand jury in&nbsp;December 2020&nbsp;along with five others, including his former promotor Antonio Strong, who plead not guilty.&nbsp;</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><a href=# rel=nofollow>According to a press release by the U.S. Attorney’s Office</a>, legal documents from November 2018 stated that Wright falsely told a federal agent that he never worked with or was assisted by Strong. He never provided Strong with any money; he never received anything of value from him; and he had no direct relationship with the promoter.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">However, it is alleged that Strong worked with and assisted Wright since 2016.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1429206386.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Per release, Wright and the co-defendants were <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1234776719>accused of using stolen payment</a> and credit card information to purchase four private jet charters for a total cost of over $80,000; over $34,000 in exotic car rentals including a Mercedes Benz 5560 and a Cadillac Escalade; and over $14,500 for a villa rental in Jamaica.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The actual cardholders discovered these transactions on their accounts and disputed the charges with their card companies, who then charged back the transactions to the businesses and individuals, which consequently suffered losses in the amounts of the unauthorized transactions.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“On social media, Mr. [Herbert] Wright boasted an extravagant lifestyle,” United States Attorney, Joshua S. Levy, stated in the release. “He gave the impression that his use of private jets, luxury cars and tropical villas were the legitimate fruits of his booming rap career as ‘G Herbo.’ However, his lavish lifestyle was shamelessly built on deceit and fraud using stolen account information that inflicted substantial harm on numerous businesses, leaving a wake of victims burdened with financial losses.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“This case should serve as a stark reminder that breaking the law leads to prosecution and accountability, regardless of who you are, how many likes you rack up or how many followers you have,” he continued.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">G Herbo has yet to publicly speak on the sentencing.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5x6qbHRm6Zmq5Wjwaa6wp6bZmtdrrKivtJmp6unkpbBqrvNZp2enJWnrq15xauYrpxdZn90gJdscHFraWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
