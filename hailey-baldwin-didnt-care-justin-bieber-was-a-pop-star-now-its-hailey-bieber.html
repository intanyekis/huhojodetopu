The series follows Bieber after a four-year hiatus from recording as he prepares his upcoming fifth album, Changes. Although the series focuses on the album making process, we learn a lot about Justin & Hailey Bieber's (née Baldwin’s) marriage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The couple met in 2009 when he accompanied Hailey to the set of NBC’s Today show to see the “Yummy” singer perform. One would think Hailey had been a huge fan of his since the Biebs got his start, but it didn't turn out that way. Justin admits she wasn’t overly excited to meet him. “She didn’t care at all,” he shares.</p><p>Hailey Bieber admitted she wasn't crazed over her husband's popularity at the time. “I was never a superfan, of him or of anyone,” Hailey told Vogue. “It was never that crazed, screaming thing. I didn’t think about it in any kind of way except for the fact that he was cute. Everybody had a crush on him.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the fourth episode of the docuseries, Hailey opens up about the moment that she told her parents about wanting to marry the pop star, who proposed around a month after they began publicly dating again following their 2016 split.</p><p>In 2018, during their split, Justin rekindled his relationship with actress and singer Selena Gomez. Bieber and Gomez began dating in 2011 when he was 16 and she was 18. They were on and off until 2018. In a recent interview with <a href=#>NBC</a>, Gomez revealed she received emotional abuse during her relationship with Justin, but it's not clear when in the relationship the alleged emotional abuse occurred. Shortly after his breakup with Gomez, Justin proposed to Hailey.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“In my heart I knew that’s what I wanted to do,” the 23-year-old admitted.</p><p>The model revealed she immediately called her parents after Justin proposed in July 2018. “This is the time I need you to stop me from doing something crazy if you think this is a bad idea.”</p><p>Hailey said she expected them to tell her to relax and to see how she&nbsp;felt&nbsp;in the next 24 hours or a week. However, they responded, “Honestly, we think that this is meant to be for you and we know that this is what you want, so we trust you.”</p><p>The couple married in a New York City courthouse in September 2018 and held a larger reception the following year at the Montage Palmetto Bluff in South Carolina.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One thing's for sure, the couple's love for each other doesn't go unnoticed.&nbsp;When Justin was diagnosed with Lyme Disease at the end of 2019, Hailey supported him by stating the severity of the disease and how it shouldn't be treated as a joke. They even share relationship tips for other couples. On Wednesday, January, Justin posted an Instagram story photo of his essentials which included the 2011 book, His Needs, Her Needs: Building an Affair-Proof&nbsp; Marriage&nbsp;by Willard F. Harley, Jr.</p><p>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin Bieber's New Documentary Touches On His Struggles With Lyme Disease</a></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The "Love Yourself" singer took to his Instagram earlier this month to express his love for his wife, and denied that his posts are not meant to subliminally target any of his exes.</p><p>“I don’t post this to prove anything or to try and make people believe I love my wife, I simply think it’s an honoring thing to do, publicly acknowledging your significant other!” he wrote at the time. “It's like we’re all okay with acknowledging an achievement or award, but think there has to be something shady about saying something publicly about the one you love. I have nothing to prove by saying I love my wife. I just think there is power in putting ur wife on a pedestal!”</p><p><span class=related-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>20 Photos That Change The Way We See Justin Bieber</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifmqGcmsZursClm7ChnmKxqrDNrWScmaKaeqvB0q2gp2WSnrKjsdFmrpqrXZZ6sbvPZqqtmaJiu7DDjKKrrGWYlratsdhmmaKdkpq%2FcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
