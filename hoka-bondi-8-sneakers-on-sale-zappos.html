I recently had bunion correction surgery on my left foot, and all over the web, these sneakers get recommended for post surgery. I thought it was all hype & really didn’t want to spend so much $ given that I also have waterproof On Cloud sneakers. Well, I caved and bought them. You will NOT regret this purchase. I’m so glad I got them. The support is incredible and will come to great use in September when I go back to school. These sneakers are a wonderful investment for my post-surgery recovery. Buy them.”</p><p>Another Zappos reviewer added, “These shoes were so comfortable and supportive right out of the box. I needed a wide platform to walk on after knee surgery.
