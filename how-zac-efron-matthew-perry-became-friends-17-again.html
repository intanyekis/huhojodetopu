The friendship was originally a mentorship from an older actor to a younger one but over time, grew to be that of an appreciation for one another's acting skills and authenticity as people.</p><p>When Perry and Efron were cast together to star in a film, no one, including critics, expected it to be anything but a flop. But despite the cards being stacked against them, their film went on to become a rousing success. The success helped Perry and Efron build their resumes outside their television roles, <a href=#><strong>Friends</strong></a> and High School Musical, respectively, which led to bigger roles for the two as a result.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/your-paragraph-text-2023-11-11t144336-014.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Matthew Perry Wasn't In The Mood To Take Any Pictures During One Of His Final Public Outings</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Matthew Perry wasn't showing any negative signs during one of his final outings, though he did reject a certain request.</span><p>What is interesting is that Efron and Perry may both have had starring roles in their film, but they never shared any scenes together. Despite this, Perry and Efron became unlikely friends after their movie was a surprise hit and kept this friendship until Perry's untimely death in October 2023.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=zac-efron-and-matthew-perry-39-s-film-39-17-again-39-did-better-than-expected>Zac Efron And Matthew Perry's Film '17 Again' Did Better Than Expected</h2><p>In 2009, Efron and Perry were cast in the film 17 Again. The film was about Perry's character being upset with the direction that his life has gone since he was the star basketball player in high school.</p><p>While reminiscing about the good 'ol days, Perry's character makes a wish to be 17 years old again — a wish that comes true and Perry's character turns into his 17-year-old self, played by Efron.</p><p>On its face, 17 Again appeared to be like every other body switch movie to hit the big screen. When it was clear that the film dug deeper into the characters than audiences expected it to and was funnier than anticipated to boot, critics took notice.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">One critic in particular, Roger Ebert, gave 17 Again a glowing review</a>. This no doubt led to more people hitting the theaters to see it, which ultimately led to a box office gross of $136 million.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/instar42543403-1.jpg><p>"I've seen Body Switches before (Tom Hanks in "Big"). The first act of this movie seemed all retread," Ebert explained. "Then it started to dig in."</p><p>Ebert went on to say, "17 Again" is pleasant, harmless PG-13 entertainment, with a plot a little more surprising and acting a little better than I expected."</p><p>While this may not seem like the biggest of praise, everyone expected Ebert and other film critics to tear the film apart. When that did not happen, Warner Bros. had a hit on its hands and Perry and Efron had their star power boosted as a result.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/fans-think-they-found-graham-norton-s-most-awkward-celeb-pairing-and-it-involved-matthew-perry-with-miriam-margolyes-front-back-graham-norton-show.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Fans Think They Found Graham Norton's Most Awkward Celeb Pairing, And It Involved Matthew Perry With Miriam Margolyes</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Fans had mixed reactions to Matthew Perry and Miriam Margolyes' interview alongside Graham Norton.</span><p>The fact that the film was a rousing success was not what was as important to Efron and Perry as their friendship was that they took away from the set.

So, yeah, we kind of did become friends," Efron explained.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/screenshot-2023-11-09-at-142730-1024x573.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Efron went on to say, "He's got incredible timing. Hanging out with Matthew was probably the most valuable thing that I did. He's got some very classic mannerisms."</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Perry and Efron were asked to answer some rapid-fire questions</a> as part of an interview they were doing to promote 17 Again. When they were answering the questions, it was clear that the two had a chemistry and a sense of humor that was second to none.</p><p>"Is it easier to imitate my facial expression or the way that I talk?" Perry asked Efron.</p><p>"You have a very distinct smile," Efron replied.</p><p>"I do?" Perry asked.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/matthew-perry-revealed-the-one-strict-rule-the-cast-of-friends-never-dared-to-break.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>A Guest Star On Friends Claims Matthew Perry Made Her Career Because Of Their Storyline On The Show</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>A certain star wouldn’t have landed a regular role in Friends, and her iconic role in Criminal Minds, without Matthew Perry’s help.</span><p>Efron said, "Yeah. You go like this." He then demonstrated the way Perry smiled and the two started laughing.</p><p>With how well the two got along on 17 Again and given the performance that Efron gave portraying Perry, it is clear why Perry wanted Efron to play him in his biopic in the future. However, there were more to the similarities that the two had in common than just acting.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Efron, too, had a partying lifestyle that cast a shadow for a time on his acting career</a> — who better to portray Perry than Efron?</p><h2 id=matthew-perry-wanted-zac-efron-to-portray-him-in-his-biopic>Matthew Perry Wanted Zac Efron To Portray Him In His Biopic</h2><p>Before Perry passed away, he divulged to entertainment reporter, Athenna Crosby that he wanted to make a biopic. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Perry also stated that he wanted Efron to portray him in his biopic</a>, a sentiment that Perry was never able to pass along to Efron before he passed but a project that the Iron Claw star would like to tackle nonetheless.</p><p>"I'm honored to hear he was thinking of me to play him," Efron stated. "We'll see. I'd be honored to do it."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/matthew-perry-2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Efron went on to say, "He was a mentor to me, and we made a really cool film together. I looked up to him, I learned comedic timing from that guy. I mean, when we were filming 17 Again, it was so surreal for me to look across and have him be there, because I've learned so much from him, from his whole life."</p><p><a href=#>Before Perry passed away, he had wanted to work with Efron on another project</a>. However, Efron passed on it. But given the influence that Perry had on Efron's career and the way he did his comedic timing in films, if the offer does come Efron's way for the Perry biopic, it would be unlikely that he would turn down the opportunity to portray Perry.</p><p><a href=#>As emotional as it would be to tackle the job of portraying Perry, Efron would take the role to honor his friend</a>. After all, given it was one of Perry's last wishes, how could Efron possibly say no?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifqK9dr66kecSfqaimXaKutcDHnq5mqJWnv7p5wZ6amqWVYrOztcSnm6xlYWx6orPAoqVo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
