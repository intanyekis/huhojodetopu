The interview was entertaining, though there were some tough moments to look back on during the chat. We'll reveal what the fans had to say about the interview, while also taking a closer look at Farley's connection with another Late Show host, <strong><a href=#>David Letterman</a></strong>.</p><p>Let's take a look back.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>David Letterman Worried He Was Going To Offend Taylor Swift By Revealing What She Smelled Like During Their Interview</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chris-farley-was-entertaining-but-out-of-breath-during-his-interview-with-jay-leno>Chris Farley Was Entertaining But Out Of Breath During His Interview With Jay Leno</h2><p>As per usual, Chris Farley entered his interview with Jay Leno on fire, handing the host some gifts, which included a cheese head and a Brett Favre jersey. The late comedian says, "Jay do you shoot pains in your arm and chest?" The moment was met with laughter, and Farley continued on without taking any breaks. He later says, "I can't breathe," Leno responds, "Take it easy."</p><p>Farley was incredibly hyped throughout the interview, and it was evident that he was struggling with substance abuse behind the scenes at the time. Still, Farley looked overjoyed any time he got a reaction out of the audience. It was his goal to put on a show no matter where he was. A lot of the time, he would joke at the expense of himself, poking fun at his appearance.</p><p>The interview was entertaining as always. Farley truly was one of the great entertainers, doing anything for a laugh.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>David Letterman Was Furious With Paul Shaffer After He Asked Julia Roberts An Inappropriate Question</a></span></p><p>The 1997 interview has a near 3 million views. As expected, fans had a lot to say about Farley during his chat on the Tonight Show.</p><h2 id=fans-felt-for-chris-farley-and-his-clear-struggles-during-the-interview>Fans Felt For Chris Farley And His Clear Struggles During The Interview</h2><p>Fans had plenty to say. For most, the interview is hard to watch years later, knowing the struggle Farley went through behind the scenes.</p><p>One fan wrote, "It’s insane to me watching this as an adult. As a kid you just assume he’s a hilarious adult with the energy level of a child, now you see how serious the addiction was. I can’t believe no one stepped in."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/instar29701916.jpg><p>Another fan wrote, "He was such a great guy & genuinely very funny in his own way, especially when he wasn’t this high. Definitely one of the biggest early losses in cinema history. Tommy Boy & Black Sheep were two of my favorite movies when I was a kid & in my teens."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED - <a href=#>David Letterman Completely Ignored His Guest's Request To Avoid The Topic Of Her Past Wardrobe Malfunction</a></span></p><p>Another fan mentions how emotional Farley's death was from a fan perspective.</p><p>"I can't even put into words of how much I love and miss Chris Farley, I will never forget the day when I heard that he had died I was 15 and I literally cried for days and not ashamed to admit that."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Farley was always willing to put on a show, and that also held true during his other appearances.</p><h2 id=david-letterman-was-another-late-night-host-that-had-a-soft-spot-for-chris-farley>David Letterman Was Another Late Night Host That Had A Soft Spot For Chris Farley</h2><p>Chris Farley was well aware that David Letterman loved physical comedy. Therefore, his entrance on the Late Show was an epic one, showing the star cartwheeling out. Not only that, but he also fell from his chair multiple times purposely to give Letterman and the audience a laugh. It was clear throughout the interview that Dave had a soft spot for the comedian.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/instar49994874-2.jpg><p>Fans discussed the chemistry between Letterman and Farley. "This is one of the few interviews that Dave is laughing so hard! You can tell he really liked Chris and recognized his raw talent."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Another fan mentions how Farley was always a class act and treated Letterman with respect during interviews.</p><p>"You don’t hear many people say “yes sir” in an interview. He was so polite and so loveable. I wish we could have all given him a giant hug. He was a key part of the early 90’s."</p><p>Sadly, Farley passed away too soon, back in December of 1997. He was only 33 at the time, passing away of an overdose. Farley will always be missed and, at the very least, fans can always look back on his brilliant moments, particularly in films and during memorable interviews.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihmrFdobKvu9JmpaivXZmypLHArJydZZeqsrTAjJyfq6GjYrOivsuesGavmKR6uK3SZpqlnZGnubp5zq6rZqeWYra1ecOuqaKml2LBqbHIq2SipqSav7e1xLBm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
