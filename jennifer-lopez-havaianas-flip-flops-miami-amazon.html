Her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">style</a> always makes headlines — and with good reason. She’s all about high-fashion, and is known as one of the red carpet’s biggest power players.</p><p>But even the biggest stars wear the same iconic items we do — especially when it comes to shoes! Whether we’re sporting <a href=# data-link=1>sneakers</a> or <a href=# data-link=1>sandals</a>, there are classic pairs of shoes and styles that practically everyone has. The brands that come to mind are Converse and Birkenstock. But there’s another name that we always think of when it comes to fabulous footwear: Havaianas! <a href=# rel=noopener>Last year</a>, Lopez was spotted rocking a pair of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their classic flip flops</a> in Miami, proving that she loves these summer shoes just as much as we do.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Havaianas-Slim-Flip-Flops-Black.jpg><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class=du>Havaianas&nbsp;</span></a><span class=eu><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Slim Flip Flops</a> starting at just $16 at Amazon!</span></strong></p><p>If you don’t already own a pair of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Havaianas Slim Flip Flops</a>, then you definitely should get on that before pool and beach season officially begins. The famous Brazilian brand is known for its basic rubber flip flops, and it’s expanded to include a wide variation of styles. Lopez was spotted wearing the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">thin-strap version</a> of the standard sandal, and they’re probably our favorite version of the classic shoe!</p><p>Lopez even went so far as to pair these seriously <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">affordable flip flops</a> with a Chanel <a href=# data-link=1>purse</a>, which we’re sure costs much more than most of&nbsp;Us&nbsp;can afford at the moment. But it is truly amazing to see a star like Lopez pair something so accessible with an item that most of the world dreams of owning. These are clearly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the flip flops</a> that you want to have in your summer wardrobe, so why not grab a pair for yourself?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Havaianas-Slim-Flip-Flops-Lilac-Announce.jpg><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class=du>Havaianas&nbsp;</span></a><span class=eu><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Slim Flip Flops</a> starting at just $16 at Amazon!</span></strong></p><p>Starting at under $20, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">these Havaianas</a> are seriously affordable. Lopez was seemingly seen wearing the classic black slim pair, but there are tons of other colors and styles to choose from at the Amazon Big Style Sale. Black is obviously a universal choice, but there are plenty of colorful pairs too if your style is brighter and bolder. If the thin strap isn’t your jam, then the classic thicker strap pair is also available for purchase. There are also embellished pairs if you want an extra little touch of bling to your look! Whichever pair you choose, we know you’ll be happy that you own a pair of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">these flip flops</a>.</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class=du>Havaianas&nbsp;</span></a><span class=eu><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Slim Flip Flops</a> starting at just $16 at Amazon!</span></strong></p><p><b><i>Check out more of our picks and deals </i></b><a href=#><b><i>here</i></b></a><b><i>!</i></b></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKCfpXq4tdOhZK6rX6OyuL%2BOo5ynppmbsrN5y6innrJdna63rciapZqrXZu5qryMn6OoqKNiuqqtzKJkmqWRr7yvew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
