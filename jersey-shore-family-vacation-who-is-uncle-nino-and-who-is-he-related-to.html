Tonight's episode was quite bittersweet, considering it's sad to see our favorite Jersey crew go, but at least they're all leaving on a good note. Despite the drama that unfolded throughout the season, especially with Angelina Pivarncik, Deena Cortese, and Jenni Farley, the group managed to come together for one last hoorah, and they just so happened to invite a special someone down for it!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The cast invited the iconic Uncle Nino to Las Vegas to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">officiate Angelina's wedding</a> re-do since the first time around wasn't so hot. In addition to Angelina and Chris' nuptials, Lauren Pesce and Mike Sorrentino discovered they were expecting their first child together after <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lauren took a pregnancy test on-camera.</a></p><p>It is clear that celebrations are very much in order, which is why it was perfect timing for Uncle Nino to make his entrance.

Nino, whose real name is Antonio Giaimo, is related to cast member and fan favorite, Vinny Guadagnino. <strong>Fans were first introduced to Uncle Nino during the original MTV series back in 2009 when Vinny's family made their debut on the show.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Viewers immediately loved Uncle Nino for his lighthearted and goofy ways, however, understanding him hasn't been such an easy task. Despite the thick Jersey accent, the star is known as the "original guido," and rightfully so. While he knows how to party, which fans have seen many, many, many times, Uncle Nino&nbsp;is also the go-to guy for many of the cast's issues.</p><p>Vinny revealed that while his father, who is separated from Vinny's mom, Paula Guadagnino, is very much in the picture, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he never wanted to be on-camera</a>. So, it was only fitting to have Vinny's uncle, Antonio, step in, a brilliant move on MTV's part, that's for sure!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=#>Vinny Trolls Entire ‘Jersey Shore’ Cast With Epic TikTok</a></span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/The-Show-With-Vinny-Uncle-Nino-e1613699654103.jpg><p><strong>During tonight's episode, Uncle Nino officiated Angelina's "re-do" wedding to her hubby, Chris.</strong> The ceremony was quite nice, however, it wouldn't be an Uncle Nino wedding without him wearing a Pope costume!</p><p>Although fans know him as quite the goofball, Uncle Nino knows a thing or two about serious business. Last season, Mike discussed his time behind bars, revealing that the inmates he bunked with had said Uncle Nino put in a good word for him.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This led many viewers to wonder whether<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Uncle Nino had also been behind bars at one point</a>, too! "They sat me down and I'm telling you, they told me to tell you, <strong>'Tell Uncle Nino that we looked out for you. We heard you put out the word and we looked out for you'," Mike said.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Uncle Nino's past certainly raises a few questions, but if there is one thing we know for sure, is that he has a heart of gold and had made Jersey Shore all that much better because of it!</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=#>‘Jersey Shore’: Snooki And JWOWW Finally Reunite</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihnqqjmsZuv8eoqZ5llpa6qrjYZq2am5GptrC6jLCfqGWZqHq2usKlnGammaO8bq3NnWSwoJ9itrR5x55kq52clsGmsIytpmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
