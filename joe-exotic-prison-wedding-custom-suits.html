Especially when it comes to his outfit, <a href=#>the Tiger King star</a> is prepared to drop some serious cash to make the day memorable.</p><p>According to <a href=#>TMZ</a>, Joe’s lawyers reached out to Odain Watson of <a href=#>L.A. streetwear brand Odaingerous</a> to see if the designer would create custom outfits for Joe and his new fiancé, John Graham. Not only has Odain agreed, but he’s having the all-white tuxedos made overseas in Italy. They’re going to cost around $11,500 per piece.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Beyoncé Invests A Small Fortune In Enhanced Water</a></span></p><p>Joe has requested that the tuxes feature a little something special – that being a custom, silk tiger-print lining. The ex-zookeeper’s lining will be bright pink, while his partner will go with a more subdued version.</p><p>This isn’t the first time Joe has collaborated with the designer. In 2020, Odaingerous signed a deal with the controversial star to release a line of themed items, including clothing, shoes, and underwear.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As per <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>, the Odaingerous x Joe Exotic collaboration made its first release in May 2020. The entire collection sold-out within a day.</p><p>“So many of the qualities in this collection aligned with the things Joe experienced on and off the show,” the designer's&nbsp;website explains of the collaboration. “Odaingerous shows the good, bad & the ugly side of Tiger King in this bold collection.”</p><p>Joe is currently serving a 22-year prison term FMC Fort Worth in Texas after being convicted of a variety of charges, including for animal abuse and murder-for-hire plot he tried to <a href=#>orchestrate against Carole Baskin</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite being incarcerated, Joe hasn’t let it stop him from finding love again. It was reported last year that Joe is seeking a divorce from his current husband, Dillon Passage. The couple married in 2017, only two months after Joe’s former husband, Travis Maldonado, died after accidentally shooting himself.</p><p>However, it was confirmed earlier this month that a part of Joe’s motivation to divorce Dillon is so he can marry a new love interest he met while behind bars.</p><p>"Mr. Maldonado-Passage is seeking a divorce from jail because he desires to marry his new love interest, Mr. John Graham whom he met in prison,” Joe’s lawyer, Autumn Beck Blackledge, confirmed to <a href=#>PEOPLE</a>.</p><p>Though the couple met while incarcerated, John has been released. However, Joe's attorney confirmed John is&nbsp;not looking to make any public statements or appearances, despite the interest around the new relationship.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though they broke up last year, Joe is still in the process of getting the divorce from Dillon. "Joe is nearing the end of his cancer treatment and has fallen in love," Joe’s attorney previously stated. "He has no ill will toward Dillon, but has been trying for a while to reach him to get a divorce settlement."</p><p>There’s no confirmation of when Joe and John plan to say ‘I do.’</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Bill Hwang Puts Out $100 Million For His Freedom</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>TMZ</a>, <a href=#>Us Weekly</a>, <a href=#>Odaingerous</a>, <a href=#>PEOPLE</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6e8monGadqKTBqq%2BMqamiq5%2Bjerixw52gp59dmMK0wM6mZKytmanAcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
