She took to Twitter to indirectly inform that she was ending her relationship with Brown.</p><p>"Listen. One can only take so much. The best of luck to Chris and his family. No baby drama for me," she tweeted.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>On the other hand, the tabloid reported the singer was happy about being a father. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Sometime later, Brown&nbsp;took responsibility for his daughter, born on May 27, 2014, and even <a href=# rel=follow>fought for her custody</a>.</p><h2>Karrueche Tran Was 'Completely Mortified' by Baby News</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The baby news definitely came as a shock for both&nbsp;Tran and Brown, as even the singer found out about the child after her birth.</p><p>But as for Tran, the news was a hard pill to swallow.

After hearing it, she felt she was "blindsided" by the singer and was "completely mortified."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>That said, she also found an opportunity to "leave it behind her and move on with her life." "She's seeing it as an opportunity to start fresh," the source added.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Karrueche Tran and Chris Brown's Fight</h2><p>A few months after the initial&nbsp;drama,&nbsp;Tran and Brown got involved in a public fight right out of the actress' house.</p><p>A report from <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">TMZ</a> reported that&nbsp;Brown was attempting to rekindle his romance with Tran when both of them were at a nightclub. But since she was not interested, she left the place and sat in her SUV. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The singer reportedly chased her and tried to get inside her car. However, she again didn't want him inside her car, too.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Sometime later at night, when she was at her home, he showed up outside and started banging her door. The incident eventually led to an unhealthy argument.</p><p>At present, <a href=# rel=follow>Tran is single</a> and focused on growing her career as an actress.
