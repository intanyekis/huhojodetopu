Additionally, Palmer is asking for sole custody of their 8-month-old son, Leodis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>However, Palmer and Jackson are currently privately mediating their custody agreement and have asked that the restraining order hearing be postponed, several weeks after Palmer’s initial filing.</p><p>Palmer claims in the initial restraining order application that there were “many instances of physical violence” between them, such as when Jackson “grabbed me around the neck, destroyed my personal property, including diaries and prescription eyeglasses, threw my belongings into the street, threw my car keys to prevent me from driving away, and hit me in front of our son.</p><p>The former couple agrees that all orders contained in the Temporary Restraining Order issued on November 9, 2023, shall remain in full force and effect until the hearing.</p><p>The latest round of court documents states that Palmer and Jackson started mediation on Wednesday. The ex-couples have decided to stay in contact at an as-yet-unspecified “mutually agreeable date.”</p><p>In their most recent filing, Palmer and Jackson are asking the court to postpone the restraining order hearing so they can work out a private custody plan.</p><p>Although the relationship ended in October, Palmer alleges that the abuse did not. “Darius trespassed into my home and stole my phone when I told him I was going to call the police,” she claims, just before the restraining order was filed.</p><p>The filing allegedly contains screenshots of security camera footage showing a man hitting a woman over a sofa.</p><p>Palmer claims that Jackson “body slammed [her] onto the stairs by her neck” in a different abuse incident that she claims happened in February 2022.</p><p>Palmer was accused of flirting with a woman by Jackson, who allegedly lost his temper with her two months later when they were at a restaurant. As a result, Palmer and Jackson left.&nbsp;</p><p>Palmer claims there was more than just physical abuse. If I talked to one person for too long or looked at someone a certain way’ at a party or event, Darius had a habit of deceiving me into thinking I was doing something improper when in reality I wasn’t.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolZq9tMPIs2Wcp51ktbC4y7KuqKeUZLimt8Rmp5qknZq%2Fbr%2FEnqKsZaCntret055kpp2Unq61tc6nZJqlmZl6pMHSraadsV2XrrXAy55kmqaUYq6tuMSgmK2hn6PAbq3GmqCnq6Risrl5w5qpoq2jYreir8qspqdn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
