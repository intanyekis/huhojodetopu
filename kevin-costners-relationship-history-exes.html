However, as Radar Online's report referred to, things became a lot more scandalous when they were in the midst of their divorce.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Who are Kevin Costner's children, according to People?</p><table border=1 cellpadding=1 cellspacing=1 align summary><tr><th scope=col><p>Child's Name</p></th><th scope=col><p>Child's Mom:</p></th><th scope=col><p>Child's Birthday:</p></th></tr><tbody><tr><td><p>Annie Costner</p></td><td><p>Cindy Silva</p></td><td><p>April 15, 1984</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Lily Costner</p></td><td><p>Cindy Silva</p></td><td><p>August 4, 1986</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Joe Costner</p></td><td><p>Cindy Silva</p></td><td><p>January 31, 1988</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Liam Costner</p></td><td><p>Bridget Rooney</p></td><td><p>November 1996</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Cayden Costner</p></td><td><p>Christine Baumgartner</p></td><td><p>May 6, 2007</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Hayes Costner</p></td><td><p>Christine Baumgartner</p></td><td><p>February 12, 2009</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Grace Costner</p></td><td><p>Christine Baumgartner</p></td><td><p>June 2, 2010</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>In February 2024, Business Insider published <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a timeline of Costner and Baumgartner's relationship</a>. That timeline outlined several potentially scandalous things that went on during their divorce. One example of that is the fact that Baumgartner implied Costner may be a cheater in court.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a legal filing, Baumgartner's legal team asked Costner to provide any documentation he had of any extramarital affairs he'd engaged in. Costner's team replied that the actor, "has no responsive documents for 'extramarital romantic relationships' in which he engaged because he engaged in none."</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/ttweb_did-no-doubt-s-success-lead-to-gwen-stefani-s-family-and-divorce-drama-_bk_a1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="Did No Doubt's Success Lead To Gwen Stefani's Family And Divorce Drama?">Did No Doubt's Success Lead To Gwen Stefani's Family And Divorce Drama?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Gwen Stefani revealed how No Doubt took her away from her family which has fans wondering if that led to her divorce.</p><p>Costner and Baumgartner's divorce seemed bitter from the outside looking in because of several other incidents. For example, Costner asked the court to force Baumgartner to move out of the home they once shared.</p><p>On another occasion, Costner's legal team claimed that Baumgartner took out cash advances on credit cards and bought a car without the actor's consent. Costner's legal team claimed that Baumgartner made those purchases before filing for divorce with the implication being that she was up to something.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/does-kevin-costner-really-get-along-with-his-biological-children_.jpg><p>Considering the accusations that once were flying back and forth, it is a good thing that Costner and Baumgartner appeared to make peace.</p><p>Based on Business Insider's timeline, it isn't surprising that Costner would want to have a good relationship with Baumgartner. After all, Costner still spoke about loving Baumgartner when he talked to Access Hollywood during their child support battle. "It feels so bad. We're talking about somebody I love on the other side."</p><p>However, Radar Online's aforementioned report, which cited the National Enquirer, suggested Baumgartner may have had ulterior motives.

At that time, TMZ published photos of the rumored couple at a tennis fundraiser for Jewel’s Inspiring Children Foundation.</p><p>The reason the photos went viral was that Costner could be seen with his hands around Jewel's waist from behind in one of them. The photos certainly implied a great deal of intimacy between the two stars.</p><p>After TMZ's report, US Weekly spoke to an insider who claimed that Costner and Jewel had been quietly dating for months by that time. The insider also spoke about how much the pair respected each other. “Kevin and Jewel had an extremely high opinion of each other and have always gotten along great. They check a lot of boxes for each other.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiinq6Zo3qku9KtpZ6qo2K%2FprjAraCopqOdtrF5x6KqraeirnqmxMSsZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
