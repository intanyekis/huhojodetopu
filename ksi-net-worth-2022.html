Yo, I’ll take it!”</p><p>“A lot of people think YouTube is quite easy when it just isn’t. I’ve been doing YouTube for six years now, and I’d say the hardest years were definitely the first three or four. You have to constantly put out content that is good just to make people come back to your channel, and I work every single day just to try and expand my brand.”</p><p>“A lot of people think being at the top means you have to be the best at a certain game. You don’t. It’s more about personality.”</p><p>“I’m now a brand. Like, KSI is a brand. It’s crazy that it all came from me sitting in my bedroom just making a few FIFA videos.”</p><p>“School taught me how to do a 9-5 job rather than be a person who wants to start a business.”&nbsp;</p><p>“I am trying to make sure that I don’t spend on ridiculous things, so that after all this YouTube thing goes, I’m not left there, like, ‘Uh oh, I have nothing.’”</p><p>Read More:</p><ul><li><a href=#>Pete Hegseth Net Worth 2022: Bio, Professional Career, Wife And More Details!</a></li><li><a href=#>Jannero Pargo Net Worth 2022: Early Life, Career And Other Less Known Facts</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfo7K1edaoqa2gX6DAqnnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal5kWlpa2diaYJ3fI4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
