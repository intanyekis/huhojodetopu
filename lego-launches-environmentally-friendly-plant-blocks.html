By 2030, the company plans on producing most of its products and packaging from eco-friendly or recycled materials.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This year, LEGO introduced sustainable plastic blocks in the shape of plants made from plant-based materials. The "Plants from Plants" set will be added free of charge to all purchases over $40 from <a href=#>the official LEGO online store</a> in the UK, Germany, and Austria between August 1 and August 17, as well as in the United States and Canada between August 1 and August 14.</p><p>The blocks are 98% polyethylene, made from sugar cane. The material adheres to <a href=#>LEGO partner</a> World Wildlife Fund’s guidelines, but it's not biodegradable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“At the LEGO Group, we want to make a positive impact on the world around us and are working hard to make great play products for children using sustainable materials. We are proud that the first LEGO elements made from sustainably sourced plastic are in production and will be in LEGO boxes this year. This is a great first step in our ambitious commitment of making all LEGO bricks using sustainable materials,” <a href=#>said Tim Brooks, Vice President, Environmental Responsibility at the LEGO Group</a>.</p><p>LEGO’s partnership with WWF aims to support and build demand for sustainably sourced plastic, an initiative spearheaded by the Bioplastic Feedstock Alliance (BFA). The plan is to source sustainable raw materials for the bioplastics industry. The plant-based plastic employed by LEGO elements is third-party certified and follows global standards for responsibly sourced sugarcane.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/LEGO-Via-The-Mac-Observer.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“It is essential that companies in each industry find ways to responsibly source their product materials and help ensure a future where people, nature, and the economy thrive,” said Alix Grabowski, a senior program officer at WWF. “The LEGO Group’s decision to pursue sustainably sourced bio-based plastics represents an incredible opportunity to reduce dependence on finite resources, and their work with the Bioplastic Feedstock Alliance will allow them to connect with other companies to continue to think creatively about sustainability.”</p><p><strong class=punchline-large>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Titanic Lego Replica Made By Autistic Boy Made It To The US</a></strong></p><p>“<a href=#>LEGO products have always been about providing high-quality play experiences</a> giving every child the chance to shape their own world through inventive play. Children and parents will not notice any difference in the quality or appearance of the new elements, because plant-based polyethylene has the same properties as conventional polyethylene,” Brooks said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGijnp%2BfYrmiwc2cn56rXZq7t7XRqKWmnZ6prq242Gadq6GVo7GtxYypo5qmpGKvrbvCpKpo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
