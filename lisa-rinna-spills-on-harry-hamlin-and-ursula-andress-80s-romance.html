They were doing ‘Clash of the Titans’ together.”</p><p>Rinna, 57, said Andress, now 84, is the one who pursued Hamlin, now 68.</p><p>“He said she called him and said, ‘Harry, come to my room.’ And so he did, at 28 years old, he went in and she got pregnant that night,” Rinna told her pals. “And that was that, at 44. First time.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/08/lisa-rinna-93.jpg><p>They stayed together until 1983. Hamlin went on to marry Laura Johnson, Nicollette Sheridan and finally Rinna in 1997. He and Rinna have two grown daughters, Delilah and Amelia.</p><p>Andress told People in an old interview of her relationship with Hamlin: “I was always very possessive, and for Harry, his career is the main thing.”</p><p>“Love affairs and husbands can end, but a child is forever. Dimitri is my love now,” she said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiokZyytLXXZ5qopV9nfXN8jmlvaGlkZLmqv8BmqaKmnpZ6tLzIpaOsZZ%2Bjeqmt0auwZqCRormquoyapZ1lpafAtrjAZpinnKKawLR5l2mqZqqfoq6vr8Ro</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
