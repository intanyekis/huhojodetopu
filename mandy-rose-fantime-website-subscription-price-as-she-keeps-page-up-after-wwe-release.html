Then, after WWE officials learned that her website had content behind a paywall, she lost her contract with the company for a breach. Unfortunately, the industry lost such a great Superstar because many believed she was more than prepared for a major push on the main roster, but that is now unlikely to happen.</p><h2><strong>Mandy Rose FanTime Website Subscription Price As She Keeps Page Up Despite WWE Release</strong></h2><h4><strong>The WWE fired Mandy Rose</strong></h4><p>Although the content Mandy Rose published on her FanTime page was unknown, it was obvious that she had one and that she charged followers to subscribe. However, WWE authorities were made aware of what was being posted and took action.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>However, monetarily, she should be fine. Her page is sure to earn her far more money than a contract with the WWE would, especially in light of recent developments. They believed that it was outside the boundaries of her WWE deal, forcing them to break ways with the Superstar.</p><p>She has raised the monthly subscription fee for the website from $25 to $40, maximising her income. She can also give a greater variety of content now that she is free from an employment contract. Given the uproar, her popularity has never been stronger, which will only help her promote the website she has insisted will remain while thanking followers for their support.</p><p>The severity of Mandy Rose’s punishment has many fans baffled, especially when contrasted to crimes done by other Superstars who earned significant boosts subsequently. The fact that the video she posted is supposedly not unlike the way she and other female Superstars are marketed by the firm has further incensed fans on social media. The company’s double standards have raised many eyebrows.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>The fact that Mandy Rose had her own website and generated income on it wasn’t a problem for the WWE; rather, they were concerned with the information uploaded. No matter what lies ahead for the former champion, she will always have a sizable following.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong>PLAY: FREE ONLINE GAMES</strong></a></p><p>Advertisement</p><p><a href=# rel="external noopener noreferrer nofollow ugc sponsored" data-wpel-link=external><strong>Recommended: Sports Fan App</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJrAsbvRraqgqpGeuW%2BvzqZmppmemcZuvs6snGaekaPBqrnEZq6emqOewaZ50q6ZrJuinr21tc6nZKmqmZiybq3SZqqhnV2gsqa80manmp%2BVYsKxecCfq56qXazEpnnRnqOemaOafA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
