You all are black,” the glamorous mayor said during the livestreamed meeting. “And you all [are] sitting up here beating and attacking a black woman that’s in power.”</p><p>Henyard, who also serves as the Thornton Township supervisor, went on to take aim at her own village trustees, who filed a lawsuit against her, alleging she forged checks and withheld financial records.</p><p>“You all forget I’m the leader. They want to hear from the mayor,” she said of the 20,000 residents. “You ain’t learned that yet.”</p><p>“The mayor — not the trustees that don’t do nothing. They only run their mouth,” she continued, clearly vexed.</p><p>“You all don’t do no work, no work.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Tiffany Henyard, the controversial mayor of Dolton, Illinois, took aim at critics at a public meeting on Monday.</figure><p>According to copies of the township’s credit card statements <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">obtained by WGN9,</a> taxpayers forked over more than $67,000 on Henyard’s trips to destinations including Austin, Atlanta and New York City, often flying first class.</p><p>In Atlanta, Henyard and her advisers stayed at the Four Seasons Hotel, spending about $9,347 there, and in New York, the group stayed at the Marriott Marquis in Times Square, where the hotel charged them $13,098.</p><p>Other charges show the township — where the median annual salary of residents is $24,000 — racked up more than $23,000 in restaurant charges across the state from July through November.</p><p>Nakita Cloud, who served for a short time as Henyard’s chief of staff in Dolton, said she would regularly invite her aides and supporters to dine at upscale restaurants at the taxpayers’ expense — even though they did not actually discuss government business.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Henyard was elected to serve as mayor of Dolton in 2021 and is also the Thornton Township supervisor. <span class=credit>Village of Dolton</span></figure><p>Meanwhile, in the village, billboards bearing Henyard’s face and name line the streets.</p><p>She is also using six village officers as her own personal security detail, according to information Fox 32 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">received from a Freedom of Information Act request</a>.</p><p>The officers are paid every two weeks — often working more than 100 hours per paycheck, and getting overtime pay as a result.</p><p>Additionally, taxpayers appear to have been charged thousands of dollars for meals and hotel rooms during a charity event for Henyard’s own cancer organization, and funds and resources were even allegedly used to pay for Henyard’s prolific social media channels.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Henyard is accused of using village police officers as her own personal security detail. <span class=credit>Instagram/stylemebrandon</span></figure><p>“I don’t think she’s fit to be mayor, I think she wants to be a reality television star,” said Cloud.</p><p>It wasn’t immediately clear if Henyard pays out of pocket for the makeup artist and stylist she enlists before any public event.</p><p>A public relations firm representing both the town and the village, though, has defended Henyard’s use of taxpayer funds.</p><p>“Regarding the charges for travel and expenses, it’s important to note these expenditures often involve a larger group of officials,” a spokesperson told WGN.&nbsp;</p><p>“These trips play a crucial role in building relationships, attracting investment and securing valuable resources for our township’s development.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Village trustees have filed a lawsuit against Henyard, alleging she forged checks and withheld financial records.</figure><p>The spokesperson added that any tax dollars that were spent on an event for Henyard’s charity “were made in accordance with approved budgets.”</p><p>But the village is now $5 million in the hole over the past two years, according to trustee Jason House.</p><p>The resulting budget cuts have been blamed for water main breaks, and for the lack of a police presence when four people were shot and injured last week.</p><p>“It’s unfortunate that politics are being played,” Police Chief Lewis Lacey said. “What’s happening is a million dollars out of my budget have been cut because of politics.”</p><p>Dolton trustee Brittney Norwood was more direct, telling Henyard at the meeting, “We’re not saying police aren’t doing a good job. We’re saying you’re assigning all of&nbsp;them to be with you when they should be out here protecting the residents so we can all feel safe,” according to WGN9.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Henyard told residents “everything we do is for the people” at the meeting on Monday. <span class=credit>Instagram/stylemebrandon</span></figure><p>Besides the alleged frivolous spending, Henyard sparked outrage over a controversial salary plan she successfully proposed for Thornton Township, which critics claim was a strategy to discourage anyone from running against her.</p><p>Henyard, who collectively earns a $285,000 salary from her two positions, proposed a nearly 90% cut to her salary if someone else wins her spot in the next election, Fox 32 reported. However, if Henyard is re-elected, her salary would remain the same.</p><p>Still, Henyard claims she is still a loyal servant to the residents.</p><p>“Everything we do is for the people … but we’re under attack,” she told residents at the meeting on Monday.</p><p>“We get scrutinized by the media. For what? Loving on the people? Showing that they matter to us?</p><p>“We go through the fires for you all,” she claimed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2tmaXBfo7K4v46mmLKnomLBqrLFmqWyZZiau7qt0Z1krKSRosBur9Giq6Kbo2LEqbuMrJiyZaOdsm6%2Fz56lnatdoa63tdKho7Jn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
