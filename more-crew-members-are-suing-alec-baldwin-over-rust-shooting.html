Most recently, a group of crew members launched a new lawsuit at the actor.</p><p>In October 2021, Alec fatally shot cinematographer Halyna Hutchins while they were shooting Rust. The gun was being used as a prop and it allegedly wasn’t supposed to be loaded. Alec claims he had no idea it would fire a real bullet when he pulled the trigger in between shooting.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>PETA Sends Rihanna A Cheeky Gift After She Wears Real Fur</a></span></p><p>According to TMZ, <a href=#>Ross Addiego, Doran Curtin and Reese Price</a> – who worked as the dolly operator, set costumer, and key grip, respectively – filed the case in tandem. They were 3 of the 7 people on set when the fatal shooting happened.</p><p>The crew members say the incident was a tragedy waiting to happen. They claim multiple security measures were overlooked, including that production failed to investigate accidental discharges that happened the day before.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The plaintiffs specifically take issue with production’s decision to use “operable firearms” for 17 of the 21 filming days. They argue that using props and special effects would’ve been a safer alternative.</p><p>The lawsuit specifically names Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, who worked as the on-set armorer. The case argues that she "lacked essential experience,” and it was an oversight to hire her. The plaintiffs say Hannah admitted to not having time to check the gun before handing it over to Alec to use in the scene.</p><p>The crew members are seeking an unspecific amount for emotional distress and intentional infliction.</p><p>This isn’t the only <a href=#>lawsuit Alec has been named in following the Rust shooting</a>. Earlier this year, the family of Halyna Hutchins filed a lawsuit against multiple people in the movie’s production, including Alec and Hannah.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, <a href=#>Alec filed his own lawsuit last year against four Rust crew members</a> for allegedly failing to safeguard the set. He’s naming Hannah, assistant director Dave Halls, gun supplies Seth Kenney, and prop master Sarah Zachry. The case remains ongoing.</p><p>Alec has maintained his innocence since the fatal shooting. In January, Alec was charged with involuntary manslaughter in New Mexico state, where filming took place. <a href=#>He’s pleading not guilty</a>. The district attorney argues that Alec’s experience should’ve made him aware of the necessary safety protocols, and he could’ve recognized when they weren’t being followed.</p><p>The D.A. furthermore alleges that Alec didn’t complete the necessary firearms training. They also claim to have video footage directly showing Alec pulling the trigger.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Drake Loses Badly After Betting $400,000 On Jake Paul</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>TMZ</a>, <a href=#>TMZ</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS6sL7EZpqrnadiuqa5wZ6prGWRp7Juv9SipaBlkaGypHnBmqOdr5mjerDCxKtkq62jqXq0tM6oq6Kml2Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
