Since she won those two fiercely competitive pageants, Culpo has gone on to become a reality TV star, model, fashion influencer, social media personality, and actress.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Given that Culpo has been willing to let fans in on her personal life, it makes sense that there has been a lot of interest in <a href=#>who she has dated in the past</a>. Most notably, a lot of Culpo's fans still think about <a href=#>her relationship with Nick Jonas</a> especially since they co-starred in the music video for his song "Jealous".</p><p>After breaking up with Jonas, Tim Tebow, and Danny Amendola, Culpo started to date the NFL running back Christian McCaffrey. Still together to this day, Culpo and McCaffrey have already been together for almost four years.</p><p>Given that Culpo's relationship with Jonas has been talked about a lot over the years, it makes sense that Nick often gets compared to McCaffrey. With that in mind, it begs an obvious question, how does Culpo's relationship with McCaffrey differ from her time with Jonas?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-was-olivia-culpo-39-s-relationship-with-nick-jonas-really-like>What Was Olivia Culpo's Relationship With Nick Jonas Really Like?</h2><p>When Olivia Culpo and Nick Jonas dated from 2013 until 2015, a lot of fans thought they were destined to be together for years. While both eventually moved on to other relationships and <a href=#>Jonas married Priyanka Chopra</a>, there were valid reasons to think the couple would go the distance at the time.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>20 Photos That Prove Nick Jonas Shouldn't Have Left Olivia Culpo</a></span></p><p>One of the most obvious reasons why fans thought Culpo and Jonas were so happy together is what happened when they appeared in public together. When Jonas and Culpo were still together, the tabloids caught photos of the couple that made it seem like they couldn't get enough of touching each other.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/olivia-culpo-and-nick-jonas-red-carpet.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The other reason why many fans thought Culpo and Jonas were going to stay together is what happened at the 2014 Miss Universe Pageant.</p><p>During the 2014 Miss Universe Pageant, Jonas performed and at one point he went into the crowd and sang directly to Culpo. At the time, many viewers thought Jonas was going to propose and even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Culpo thought he was going to pop the question</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/olivia-culpo-and-nick-jonas.jpg><p>Years after Culpo and Jonas broke up, Olivia went on to star in the reality show The Culpo Sisters in 2022. During the premiere episode of that show, Culpo reluctantly spoke about her relationship with Jonas and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">revealed how lost she felt after they split</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/olivia-culpo-and-nick-jonas-paparazzi-photo.jpg><p>“I moved to L.A. with him. I had no brand, no money and I was in love. That was great right, but when he broke up with me, I was kind of left with no sense of identity.”</p><p>“My whole identity was in him, which is a very common story of a young person in love. I thought we were going to get married, I thought all the things, and I just remember night after night looking up at my ceiling in my apartment that I couldn't afford thinking to myself how am I going to pay my rent.”</p><p>“I couldn't even afford my groceries. It was a serious, pivotal moment for me, but it was something that taught me that you can't give up.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Learning that Culpo felt like she didn't even know who she was after her relationship with Jonas ended, it is really easy to empathize with her.</p><h2 id=what-is-olivia-culpo-39-s-relationship-with-christian-mccaffrey-really-like>What Is Olivia Culpo's Relationship With Christian McCaffrey Really Like?</h2><p>Roughly four years after Olivia Culpo and Nick Jonas broke up, she started dating Christian McCaffrey. In between those two relationships, Culpo was involved with a pair of other professional athletes.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Are The Culpo Sisters? (And Why Do They Have Their Own Reality Show)</a></span></p><p>In an ideal world, everyone who has been involved in a series of relationships that ended would have figured out what they need out of a future partner. In reality, however, the truth is that a lot of people make the same mistakes in relationships over and over.</p><p>Once you learn how Culpo felt after her relationship with Nick Jonas ended, it is easy to wonder if she would feel lost again if she breaks up with McCaffrey. Fortunately for her, it seems like Culpo will be in a lot better position if she becomes single again based on what is known about their relationship, careers, and lives.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/olivia-culpo-and-christian-mccaffrey.jpg><p>In November 2022, Olivia and her sisters were interviewed by US Weekly when they were promoting their reality show, The Culpo Sisters. During the resulting conversation, Olivia spoke about how <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she and McCaffrey are committed to their careers</a>.</p><p>According to Culpo, she and McCaffrey both want “to do the things we wanna do” in their careers “while we can”. While some relationships may fail if both people involved are very focused on their careers, Culpo says that she and McCaffrey understand how to support each other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“We’re both really understanding about [our] schedules and the way that things have to work for the time being, and that definitely helps. I think when you’re on the same page with that you can, you really can make it work.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Who Is The Richest Culpo Sister? A Look At How They Earn Their Net Worths</a></span></p><p>During that same interview, Culpo expressed her opinion that if you are in a relationship with someone, you have to accept what they need to accomplish.</p><p>“I feel like when you care about somebody, you have to understand the things that they’re gonna have to do to reach their dreams and potential. And part of that means being apart.”</p><p>Given that Culpo spoke about feeling like she didn't have a career following her breakup with Jonas, it is clear that she is in a very different situation in that regard now that she is dating McCaffrey.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On top of feeling more independent now than she did when she was dating Jonas, Culpo's career makes her relationship with McCaffrey different in another notable way.</p><p>Back when Culpo was dating Jonas, fans had very limited knowledge of the lifestyle Olivia was leading. These days, however, Culpo is much more public with her private life thanks to her reality show and her status as a social media influencer.</p><p>Finally, it has to be noted that since McCaffery is the athlete and Culpo is the reality star, the public generally sees their relationship from her perspective. On the other hand, since Jonas was much more famous than Culpo during their relationship, fans seemed to mostly perceive things from his perspective at the time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGimpaGmnq5ur9Slp6hlkaOxbrrInKJmop%2BjrrR50Z6jmqyZpLu0tMipZLChpJ16pLTRoqqtoZGjeq6vwpqdn6qVrnqltcWfnKudnpiytHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
