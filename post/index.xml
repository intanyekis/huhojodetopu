The ingredient that gives it its distinctive smell is nepetalactone.&amp;nbsp;This compound serves a vital function for these plants by repelling insects. Interestingly, the chemical disappeared early in the evolutionary history of the genus, only to re-emerge later. New evidence suggests that it can have a similar use for humans as a chemical that is even more effective than DEET.</description></item><item><title>Clermont Twins Without Makeup At The Airport</title><link>/clermont-twins-without-makeup-at-the-airport.html</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/clermont-twins-without-makeup-at-the-airport.html</guid><description>Latest in Bollywood is an independent news media organization Founded in 2018 with the aim to become the ultimate source of the latest updates, exclusive news, and captivating stories from the world of entertainment.
