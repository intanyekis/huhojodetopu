The trio decided to arrive to the Red Notice premiere in color0coordinated ensembles that set the red carpet on fire.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>The actors, whom star alongside each other in the 2021 action movie, clearly put some thought into their all-red outfits, ensuring that a fabulous (and <a href=#>fashion forward</a>) photo op was sure to be had.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>Gadot served up quite the style statement, shimmering in a stunning red sequin dress by Loewe. The 36-year-old actress, who was styled by <strong>Elizabeth Stewart</strong>, accessorized the look with Stuart Weitzman heels and Tiffany & Co. earrings boasting a total of 15 carats, as well as a bracelet with 17 carats of blue cupric elbaite tourmaline and 4 carats of diamonds.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>In the beauty department, the Wonder Woman actress worked with hairstylist <strong>Renato Campora</strong> for a slicked-back style that fell just above her shoulders. She then turned to <strong>Sabrina Bedrani</strong> for a full face of Dior makeup that oozed Old Hollywood glamour.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>While Gadot’s glitzy getup certainly stole the show, her male costars <a href=#>didn’t disappoint either</a>. Reynolds, 45, was her perfect counterpart in a very chic velvet three-piece suit by Giorgio Armani. He paired the dapper tuxedo, which had some subtle orange undertones, with a pair of brown suede shoes and a patterned tie.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>Johnson, while not overtly in an identical color to his two costars, did stick with the red theme, opting for a deep wine-colored <span>suit. He teamed his velvet getup with a white button-down that exposed </span><a href=#>some of his chest tattoos</a><span> and grey suede loafers.</span><span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>The matching red carpet moment only made sense for the trio, as they apparently have amazing “natural chemistry” in front of a camera.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“I think just seeing the dynamic between the three of us [is what fans will love the most]. We’ve all known each other for years and year and years,” Reynolds told <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a>. “But there’s a chemistry there that you can’t really make up and there’s a big old-fashioned, squash-buckling, comedic adventure and it’s the kind of movie I grew up on and loved and I’m really, really excited about it.”<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1>Fans will want to soak up Reynolds’ most recent movie as he recently revealed that he’ll be taking a little break from acting. “Perfect time for a little sabbatical from movie making,” he wrote via Instagram in October after wrapping up his holiday film, Spirited.<span class=Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvRnptmpp%2BptqSxjKmpnqWZmr%2BmeZFpaWplopqxbq%2FAq6eerF2brrS0yKilaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
