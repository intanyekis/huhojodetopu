My comment afterward was clumsy and awkward. I sincerely apologize. Please know my heart (literally and figuratively) was well-intentioned. I will do better.”</p><p>He followed that up with <a href=# rel=noopener>a column</a> that he began with, “I’m devastated to realize I’m part of the problem” and concluded by saying, “Caitlin Clark, I’m so sorry.”</p><p>Fans and media alike took to X on Wednesday, blasting Doyel for the exchange, calling him “creepy” and “unprofessional.” Others pointed out that this was not the only awkward interaction Doyel had on Wednesday, just the only one that went viral.</p><p>He later asked Fever head coach <strong>Christie Sides</strong> about Clark, referring to the basketball phenom as “that” and “it.”</p><p>“You were just given the keys to that. What are you going to do with it?” he asked Sides, 47.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Caitlin-Clark-Gets-Apology-From-Reporter-After-Press-Conference-Gaffe-%E2%80%98Im-Part-of-the-Problem-2.jpg><p>The Athletic’s <strong>Dana O’Neil</strong> <a href=# rel=noopener>pointed out</a> that Doyel, for whatever reason, found it appropriate to make a heart hand gesture toward Clark that he probably would not make toward a male athlete.</p><p>“Sometimes life isn’t hard,” she wrote via X. “If, for example, as a professional, ethical, impartial reporter it would not occur to you [to] make a heart at, say, <strong>Victor Wembanyama</strong>, don’t make one at Caitlin Clark.”</p><p>The Next’s <strong>Howard Megdal</strong> <a href=# rel=noopener>added</a> that interactions like this erode the trust between media and athletes — a topic that is often the center for debate in WNBA media circles.</p><p>“I am angered and sickened by this,” he wrote. “It is incumbent upon reporters to come to press conferences with knowledge and respect. And players cannot, and should not, be treated this way. This is a problem well beyond this specific dynamic. So many of us work every second to build trust.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>This is not the first time Doyel has found himself under fire for making inappropriate comments. Users on X quickly unearthed a number of lewd comments he has made on the site, including one about a column he wrote about <a href=#><strong>LeBron James</strong></a> in 2010.</p><p>“Just realized my LeBron column references masturbation, gang bangs and oral sex,” <a href=# rel=noopener>he wrote</a>. “Damn. I’m twisted.”</p><p>Clark, meanwhile, has plenty to concentrate on aside from a viral exchange with a reporter. Not only is she gearing up for her first season of professional basketball, she’s also reportedly on the verge of signing an <a href=# rel=noopener>eight-figure sneaker deal</a> with Nike.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKmeqJ%2Bnwaa%2BjJqnqKSfnLa7sdJmq6hlk5a2tbjIp2ScpJGnuG6yzqtkr6GilrluvNGeqqxlk6S7p7HRnqWcnV2crqeyxGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
