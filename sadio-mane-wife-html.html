The footballer has also never posted&nbsp;pictures of him with a woman on social media.&nbsp;In fact, the only pictures he uploads are of him playing football.</p><h2>Battling Rumors Of Marrying A Tunisian Woman</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Back in 2018, Tunisia's 'Radio Mosaique FM' had claimed that Mane had plans of&nbsp;getting&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">married</a>&nbsp;to a Tunisian woman for which he had rented the 28,000-seat Stade Olympique de Sousse. This news was picked up by&nbsp;Connor Dunn of the Liverpool Echo and then by other African outlets.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>&nbsp;Mane later clarified on Facebook&nbsp;that the news was false. He disreputed the report on the grounds of wrong and unfounded information and claimed that he was totally dedicated to his work.</p><p>Dear all, it was with amazement and dismay that I learned a supposed gala game that I should organize in Sousse, Tunisia, on the occasion of my wedding. I&nbsp;want to deny this information to the last energy. I have never sent or ordered a third person to speak on my behalf to the Tunisian municipal or public authorities.</p><p>-Sadio Mane&nbsp;</p><p>Since this wedding rumor, he has been linked to two other women.&nbsp;<span>He was allegedly&nbsp;</span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><span>dating</span></a><span>&nbsp;socialite Kate Bashabe&nbsp;after being spotted together on social media. </span>She posted pictures of herself at Anfield stadium, an appearance that the press assumed she made to support Mane. However, the young entrepreneur denied these rumors, claiming that she wasn't in a secret relationship with the Liverpool striker.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the latest news, Mane is in a&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">relationship</a>&nbsp;with Carol Tshabalala, the award-winning South African sportscaster. Tshabalala&nbsp;had recently been posting a lot of pictures with Mane, which led to the rumors. Mane has neither accepted nor denied dating her as of now. &nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>It’s Sadio day today ðŸ’ƒðŸ¾ðŸ’ƒðŸ¾ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ Blessed abundantly already, more heading your way.

He is also part of the national football squad for Senegal. The footballer has had to work really hard to pave his way to fame and glory.&nbsp;</p><p>Mane was born and raised in a small village in Bambali, Senegal, and&nbsp;decided to pursue a career in&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">football</a>&nbsp;when he watched his country's national team playing in the 2002 World Cup. He&nbsp;made his football debut with the French club Metz and later joined the Red Bull Salzburg. After winning the Austrian Bundesliga and Austrian Cup, he was signed up by Southampton where he set a record of scoring the fastest hat-trick.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2016, he was signed up by Liverpool for 34 million euros which made him the most expensive African footballer at&nbsp;that&nbsp;time. He has also played for the Senegalese national team.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Mane was ranked&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">fifth</a>&nbsp;in 'Best FIFA Men's Player' in 2019 and the fourth-best in 2020.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Despite Sadio Mane denying all reports of dating and taking a wife, the footballer continues to remain in the news for his prowess in the playing field.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGipnqSRqbawutKhoKlno5axqruMppinnV2stqexjaGrpqQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
