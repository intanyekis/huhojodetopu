They had been found dead in a car.</p><h2>What happened to Savannah Soto?</h2><p>Savannah Soto, an 18-year-old pregnant teenager, went missing along with her boyfriend, Mathew Guerra, on December 22, 2023. The teen was scheduled for induced labor over the weekend but never showed up at the hospital. Her concerned mother, Gloria Cordova, who last heard from her daughter on Friday, filed a missing person report to the Leon Valley Police. A CLEAR Alert was issued for Soto by the Texas Department of Public Safety. CLEAR stands for Coordinated Law Enforcement Alert Rescue Program.</p><p>Both families also filed a missing person report with SAPD on Saturday. However, one had already been issued in Leon Valley. On Tuesday, December 26, 2023, at 4 p.m., SAPD was called to assist the Leon Valley Police Department at the 5900 block of Danny Kaye. Families of both victims were at the location and told the Police that they had received information that the missing gray Kia Optima, Guerra’s vehicle, was at the above address. Police did not disclose the source of the information. When the Police arrived, they discovered the bodies of Soto and Guerra.</p><p>“it appeared that the vehicle had been at the location for several days,” SAPD Chief William McManus said.</p><p>On Thursday afternoon, the Bexar County Medical Examiner’s Office said that Savannah’s cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and her death was a homicide. The Bexar County Medical Examiner also noted that Mathew Guerra had died of a contact wound to the head, and the manner of death was also ruled a homicide.</p><h2>Have the Police found Savannah’s Killer?</h2><p>The detectives are investigating both homicides and combing through days of surveillance videos from several locations where the victims were known to be. The SAPD released a video of two people of interest in the capital murder and a dark-colored pickup truck.</p><p>The Police have asked the citizens to come forward with any information they have on Soto, Guerra, the dark-colored pickup truck, or the two people of interest. Anyone with any information that might help with the investigation is encouraged to contact SAPD Homicide at (210) 207-7674 or (210) 207-7440. Callers may remain anonymous.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7trzTqKqpnZWZt7DB0aeYpaGjonuku8xopZ6vo2TAosLAp6WaoF2ovLW7jJyYrJ1dqr2lrdOeZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
