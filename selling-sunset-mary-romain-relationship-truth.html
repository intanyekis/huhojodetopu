And Mary and Romain do have a real "meet cute" story to tell.</p><p>In fact, the pair met when Mary was Romain's real estate agent upon his move to the US, noted&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Women's Health Mag</a>. Romain was hoping to pursue more modeling gigs in LA, Mary explained.</p><p>But there is a bit more to the pair's relationship than their appearances on the Netflix reality show revealed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cast Of Selling Sunset, Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Netflix already showed fans&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">inside Chrishell's lavish wedding</a>, so they had to do the same with Mary and Romain. The catch, however, was that Mary and Romain's relationship wasn't all that it seemed the day they tied the knot.</p><p>Sure, fans knew the couple had been together for a while before the wedding aired. But the truth was, the pair had been married for nearly a year before their wedding graced fans' screens.</p><p>Yep, Mary and Romain were wed in March of 2018 at the Ventura Courthouse, explained&nbsp;Women's Health Mag. They filed all the appropriate paperwork;&nbsp;TMZ obtained their marriage license and certificate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Then, in October of 2019, the two had a lavish wedding filmed by Netflix for their reality show. In defense of the couple's deceitful nuptials, which they never let on wasn't their official wedding, nor their first, the couple's rep said that "in their minds, they weren't properly married until the wedding that was filmed during the show."</p><p>Still, fans were miffed. Why lie about already being married? Besides, plenty of people get married in a civil ceremony and throw a big wedding afterward. It's often easier to do because they can secure their marriage license without worrying about deadlines and paperwork. Then all that's left is to enjoy the wedding.</p><p>Regardless, fans aren't sure they approve of Mary and Romain's marriage, especially being that Mary's on the fence about having more kids (she plans to freeze her eggs) and Romain is only four years older than her son.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since the realtor is 39 and in no rush to have more babies, notes&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ScreenRant</a>, the couple is holding off on attempting to conceive. Right now, they're just enjoying their time together and their work, says Mary.</p><p>Of course, fans have their doubts about whether the pair's marriage will last, but they'll just have to tune into 'Selling Sunset' to see how it turns out.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Cast Of Selling Sunset Ranked By Instagram Followers</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiqnqScnruoedKupaydpGK6or7YZqmopZGeu26%2BxKWYraGfo8Cptc9mq6utpJ18</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
