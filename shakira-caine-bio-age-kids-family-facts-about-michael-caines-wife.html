Legend has it that the actor saw her in a TV commercial and was immediately struck by her beauty. He described her as the most beautiful woman he had ever seen and set about using his contacts to find her. He eventually got her number from a friend in the advertising industry and reached out to her. Caine was not initially enthusiastic about his approach but later warmed to his affections. She accepted to go on a date with him and the rest, as they say, is history. The couple tied the knot in Las Vegas in January 1973 and have been together ever since then. In a 2016 interview on The Jonathan Ross Show, her husband disclosed that the secret to their long union is the fact that they have separate bathrooms.</p><p>Shakira Caine and her husband have one child together; her name is Natasha Haleema Caine and she was born in 1973. There is not much information about Natasha’s professional life. However, she has often landed in the spotlight due to her love life. She has been married twice and divorced twice.

Natasha then got married to a property developer, Michael Hall, in 2007. The marriage produced two sons and a daughter and Natasha filed for divorce in 2013. The divorce was ostensibly caused by her husband’s failure to pay off some embarrassing debts that he owed his business partner. Shakira Caine also has a stepdaughter named Dominique, from her husband’s first marriage.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=facts-to-know-about-michael-caines-wife></span><strong>Facts To Know About Michael Caine’s Wife</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>1.
