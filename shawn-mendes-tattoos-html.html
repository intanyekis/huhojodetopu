And we all know that. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>But the 22-year-old is also equally&nbsp;enthusiastic about his tattoos. That's why&nbsp;he regularly adds to the number of tattoos on his body.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Just this year in May,&nbsp;Mendes got inked on his left forearm&nbsp;and right&nbsp;shoulder with the help of popular tattoo artist&nbsp;Kane Navasard. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>"No bad vibes. Some tattoos for the man @shawnmendes,"&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Navasard wrote in his Instagram post</a>, showing off the singer's new tattoos. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><h2>Meaning of His New Tattoos</h2><p>Both new tattoos of Mendes are texts which have significant meanings.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The ink on his&nbsp;left forearm&nbsp;read "GOOD BOY," which is dedicated to his&nbsp;friendship group&nbsp;Good Boy Club, according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">his fan page @shawmila.media</a>&nbsp;on Instagram. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Just in case you didn't know,&nbsp;Mendes and his friends&nbsp;Connor Brashier and Matty Peacock refer to their group as&nbsp;Good Boy Club. In fact, one of&nbsp;Mendes' other fan pages on Twitter revealed that his friend&nbsp;Peacock also has a similar tattoo on his hand.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Mendes' second new tattoo on his right&nbsp;shoulder reads "fe," which means faith in Spanish.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>On May 27, the singer also <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">took to his Instagram</a> to share a series of snaps from his inking session with&nbsp;Navasard. In the&nbsp;post, he tagged Brashier. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Mendes’ Other Tattoos</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>In addition to his new tattoos, the 'Señorita' singer <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">has a flurry of tattoos</a> around his body, one of which reads "little sunflower," inked just&nbsp;below his right armpit.</p><p>There are rumors that&nbsp;Mendes got this tattoo for his girlfriend&nbsp;Camila Cabello since her&nbsp;favorite flower is a sunflower.</p><p>The&nbsp;Pine Ridge Secondary School alum has also got&nbsp;"Wonder" tattooed on his right biceps, honoring his album and the single of the same name. But, again, many presume that the&nbsp;word was written in Cabello's handwriting. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Another special tattoo — his sister's name "Aaliyah Maria"&nbsp;— is inked on his&nbsp;shoulder blade, in a beautiful script. Not only that, Mendes&nbsp;has&nbsp;the letter "A" in a unique script,&nbsp;behind his right ear, as a second tattoo tribute to his sister.</p><p>What's more?&nbsp;Mendes tattooed a butterfly on his right arm after a fan edited one of his old photos with the butterfly design. The singer loved the image and decided to get the tattoo.</p><p>His <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">other tattoos have historical meanings</a>, too. He has a drawing of a sparrow&nbsp;bird on his right hand since&nbsp;he spends much of his time on tour, traveling the world. And it is said that&nbsp;sailors used to get such tattoos before they started traveling. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The singer's most creative and beloved tattoo is&nbsp;a guitar on his left arm.&nbsp;Mendes' guitar tattoo has two significant meanings, as the&nbsp;upper section of the guitar's handle&nbsp;shows&nbsp;the Toronto skyline, while&nbsp;the bottom section is a wavelength of his parents saying, "I love you."</p><p>If you were wondering which is his biggest tattoo, it is of a lightbulb with blue flowers on his&nbsp;right arm. The tattoo represents his illuminate era, and the blue flowers are his mom's favorite.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>He even has some&nbsp;miniature tattoos around his fingers, one of which is an elephant on his left middle finger. Another one is an "8" written on the middle finger of his left hand, signifying his birthday —&nbsp;8/8/1998.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKuYlsSvecyepZ2do2LBosDTqKasZpipuq0%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
