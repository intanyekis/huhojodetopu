Up until now, the Eras tour revolved around one special rule, which she had adhered to almost every single time. But now, the singer has decided to disregard it, and swifties have mixed feelings about it.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-announced-a-huge-change-in-her-upcoming-performances>Taylor Swift Announced A Huge Change In Her Upcoming Performances</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/taylor-swift-2022-mtv-video-music-awards-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taylor Swift's Eras tour continues to make history as one of the biggest tours in the world. Not only is it constantly breaking records when it comes to earnings and size of the audience, it's also one of the most creative and musically rich tours in a long time.</p><p>Throughout the concerts, she performs a selection of the different eras in her discography. That way, devoted swifties get to enjoy a little bit of all the albums, and casual listeners or plus ones get a taste of every different side of her music.</p><p><strong>Another thing that makes the concerts so iconic are the infamous surprise songs. These are a source of happiness for some swifties and anxiety for others.</strong></p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><span>2:05</span> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/how-many-songs-has-taylor-swift-written-1.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=# title="How Many Songs Has Taylor Swift Written?">How Many Songs Has Taylor Swift Written?</a></h5><p class=display-card-excerpt>Taylor Swift has penned plenty of hits, but how many songs has she actually written in total?</p><p>Taylor Swift has a carefully curated set list of what she thinks is the best of every era, but every night she adds a special song, one that isn't played again throughout the rest of the tour. <strong>That's worked great so far, but now Taylor has had enough of it.</strong></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I want to be as creative as possible with the acoustic set moving forward and <strong>I don't want to limit anything or say, 'If I played this song, I can't play it again'</strong>," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she announced, almost casually, at a Melbourne show</a>.</p><p>"<strong>So, from now on, I don't want to take any paint colors out of the paintbox or tools out of the toolbox.

It just means Taylor has played a lot of shows.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1lkaO7sMHNnJysZZSnrrTAyJxknKCRo7SmecSrmKxlpKTCs3nPnqmfp6Kirq%2BvxKxkn5meqHqltdWim56cXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
