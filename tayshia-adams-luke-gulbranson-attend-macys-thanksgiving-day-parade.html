(Cohen also brought his eldest child, 4-year-old son Ben, to the parade.)</p><p class=p1>Adams looked effortlessly chic in a chocolate-colored coat and a matching turtleneck, which she coordinated with silver drop earrings and matching rings. She wore tortoise sunglasses, which perfectly matched Gulbranson’s shades. He sported a black peacoat and a gray scarf.</p><p class=p1>Adams also documented <a href=#>her day at the festive occasion</a> via her Instagram. “I can’t believe this!!!!!! I get to go to the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade today,” she wrote via her Instagram Story. “What a dream come true.”</p><p class=p1>Adams, who flashed her purple tickets in the social media footage, noted that it’s her first time attending the holiday parade.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Bachelorette-Tayshia-Adams-and-Luke-Gulbranson-Beam-at-Thanksgiving-Parade-3.jpg><p class=p1>“This is like, truthfully, something my family and I would watch every Thanksgiving morning,” she further explained in a timestamped post from 6:00 a.m. “Look how cool this is?

Neither Adams nor Gulbranson addressed the pic, but Hubbard, 37, quickly deleted her post and then re-uploaded a cropped version without them.</p><p class=p1>“It may seem like they’re moving fast, but they don’t care what other people think,”<a href=#> a source exclusively told <i>Us Weekly </i></a>in May after Adams and Gulbranson were spotted at a jewelry store. “They’re mad about each other and serious about their future.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Bachelorette-Tayshia-Adams-and-Luke-Gulbranson-Beam-at-Thanksgiving-Parade-2.jpg><p class=p2>Prior to finding love with Gulbranson, Adams was married to <strong>Josh Bourelle</strong> from 2016 to 2017.
