As seen in images on the website, the size 9.5 Vans appear worn, distressed and covered in Barker’s <a href=#>own blood</a>. The shoes were shipped out in a “museum grade display case” and included a signed certificate of authenticity, per Trophy. The identity of the customer who scored the footwear has not yet been revealed.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>In addition to the Vans, the Trophy collection includes Barker’s bloodstained black pants from the tour — which sold for $6,000 — as well as several sets of drumsticks and an array of drum heads.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>“In 2023, Travis Barker set out on an unforgettable global tour with Blink-182 leaving behind a trail of extraordinary performances,” reads a description for the collection. “Capturing the essence of these iconic shows, Trophy has proudly collaborated with Travis to curate a unique collection of tour-used, show-played memorabilia throughout the 2023 World Tour and recording of Blink-182’s latest album, One More Time.”</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Travis-Barker-Sells-His-Bloody-Vans.jpg><p class=p1><span class=s1>Proceeds from the Travis Barker x Trophy sales are going toward Lost But Not Forgotten CA, a nonprofit organization with the goal of identifying and adopting teenagers in the Roseville area “who are experiencing a temporary hardship that doesn’t allow them to have a normal Christmas.”&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Blink-182 — which includes Barker, guitarist <strong>Tom DeLonge</strong> and vocalist <strong>Mark Hoppus</strong> — kicked off their Rock Hard Tour in May, taking a pause following the birth of Barker and wife <a href=#><strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong></a>‘s <a href=#>first child together</a> last month. The group will hit the road again in <a href=#>summer 2024</a> in support of their new album, One More Time, which dropped in October.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Us Weekly confirmed in November that Kardashian, 44, gave birth in Los Angeles.
