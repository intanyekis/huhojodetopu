Hailing from the Bronx, which is undoubtedly the birthplace of the genre, Terror Squad was responsible for some of the most iconic hip-hop tracks that defined the decade, like "Lean Back" and "Whatcha Gon' Do." The original line-up consisted of Fat Joe, Big Pun, and Cuban Link, alongside DJ Khaled and Cool and Dre in the mixing booth, while Remy Ma and Tony Sunshine joined later on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Happened To D12? Here's Everything Eminem's Former Groupmates Have Been Up To</a></span></p><p>However, following the death of its prolific lyricist <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Big Pun</a> from a fatal heart attack in 2000, Terror Squad lost its direction and quickly disintegrated. Although there had been plenty of attempts to reunite, many of its members then went on their separate ways since then. So, what are they looking like in recent years? Here's what Fat Joe and co from Terror Squad have been up to since the group's split.</p><h2 id=cool-amp-dre><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Cool & Dre</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cool & Dre, consisting of Marcello "Cool" Antonio Valenzano and Andre "Dre" Christopher Lyon, is a songwriting and production duo that's responsible for some of the earliest projects of Fat Joe and Terror Squad. Since their split, they still produced for some of the biggest talents on Earth, including Lil Wayne in Tha Carter II, Tha Carter III, Tha Carter IV, and Tha Carter V, and Jay-Z and <strong><a href=#>Beyonce</a></strong>'s Everything Is Love collab album in 2018.</p><h2 id=dj-khaled><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>DJ Khaled</span></h2><p>Before becoming a successful solo artist, DJ Khaled elevated his popularity by working as a DJ for Terror Squad during their live performances. He was signed to Terror Squad Entertainment and released his first two albums under the imprint with moderate success. After their split, he continued making a name for himself in the rap game despite <a href=#>countless controversies</a> regarding his artistry. He's currently gearing up for an upcoming album titled God Did.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Happened To G-Unit?

In fact, she had her first Grammy nomination thanks to "Lean Back" from their second and final album, in which she was heavily involved. As a solo artist, Ma's debut album, There's Something About Remy, was a critical success despite being a commercial lackluster. She's currently gearing up for an upcoming album titled Reminisce, which was named after her daughter.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cuban-link><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Cuban Link</span></h2><p>Cuban Link, whose real name is Felix Delgado, was associated with Big Pun in the late 1990s before joining Terror Squad. After Pun's death, Delgado had a contract dispute with the group's honcho, Fat Joe, which resulted in delays of his intended debut album 24k. The album ended up getting shelved, and in exchange, he released his debut titled Chain Reaction in 2005. Now, it seems like the rapper has been away from the spotlight for quite a while.</p><h2 id=tony-sunshine><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Tony Sunshine</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At the soaring age of R&B, Tony Sunshine came with his signature silky-smooth voice and served as the vocalist singer for Terror Squad. The Puerto Rican was only 13 when Big Pun took him under his guidance, and he officially left Fat Joe's camp in 2008. In his own words, "But it was time for Tony Sunshine to stand on his own two feet and become a leader of his own movement. So now I'm a free agent."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>What Happened To Macy Gray?</a></span></p><h2 id=big-pun><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Big Pun</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Big Pun has a long-lasting legacy that could never be forgotten, as he was the first Latino artist to have a platinum-certified hip-hop record with his Grammy-nominated debut album Capital Punishment. He passed away in 2000 following a series of health issues regarding his weight at the age of 28 from respiratory failure. After his death, Pun's estate released his sophomore album posthumously in April of the same year, peaking at number 3 on the Billboard 200 chart.</p><p>“22 years later we still celebrate your greatness. My brother, we miss you not a day goes by when we don’t think about or tell stories about you,” Joe wrote highly of his late friend, adding, “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The world got robbed of an incredible beautiful person 22 years ago</a> was the worst day of my life. We try to hold it down for you as best as we can, I know I’ll see you again.”</p><h2 id=fat-joe><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Fat Joe</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Outside Terror Squad, Fat Joe has released a lot of studio albums, both as a solo artist and as a duo with either Remy Ma, Dre, or DJ Drama. While he's best known for his Terror Squad project, Joe's discography as a solo artist is quite solid. His fourth platinum-certified studio album, Jealous Ones Still Envy, is often considered his best piece of bodywork and broke the charts in several countries. Over three decades in the game, Joe has cemented his name as one of the greatest, if not most successful, Latino hip-hop artists of all time. ​​​​​​​</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>What Happened To Austin Mahone?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrOiwIyjpp6rXamys77Oq2SsqaWWsW65xKaZnqqjYrWiwsRmmZ6dnmLCsXnTqGSsoZ6Ysm7Ax56gq2WjpbmqwI4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
