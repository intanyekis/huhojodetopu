But recently, her reaction to seeing a flag (as seen in the clip below) sparked rumors... "me thinking i have a chance with jenna ortega just bc she smiled at a lesbian flag," wrote a Twitter user. Fans also recalled the actress tweeting "Lesbian rights ;)" back in July 2020.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview with TV Insider, Ortega also referred to her co-star, Gwendoline Christie as her wife. "My lady," she said about <a href=#>the Game of Thrones star</a> at that time. "I cherish you. I apologize if it comes across as disrespectful, but it is the name I give her.

When asked why, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she told Gayety</a>: "I think because she's a badass. She's cool, she's got a nice sense of style, but she's somebody who embraces her differences and isn't out to please anybody. I feel like that's a really, really powerful thing to see. I feel like people want to see powerful women with powerful women."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Emma Myers Is Nothing Like Her Enid Sinclair Character On Wednesday</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jenna-ortega-is-concerned-about-wednesday-s-love-triangle>Jenna Ortega Is Concerned About Wednesday's Love Triangle</h2><p>Ortega isn't crazy about Wednesday's relationship drama. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaking to ETalk</a>, she said she "had to accept" it — before protesting: "Well, no, honestly, I'm gonna fight this love triangle thing so hard. Because it's just me being protective. Because I don't think Wednesday would ever be in a love triangle. And I talked to the writers about this, and they said, 'Don't worry, don't worry. It's not gonna be that, it's not gonna be that.'"</p><p>The 20-year-old actress added that it's "important" that any relationship should be "strictly out of pleasure, or amusement, rather than severe interest or being boy-crazy in some sense. Because honestly, I think boys are probably the last thing on Wednesday's mind." And many viewers agree (though <a href=#>some find the show "annoying"</a>). "Wednesday is so badass," tweeted a fan. "We need more role models like her for our littles."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ortega previously told MTV News</a> that she's "always been against the love triangle idea," but clarified that she sees a different potential in Wednesday and Xavier's relationship. "I think there's an opportunity there for a really sweet platonic relationship," she explained. "Because I don't think it's shown often enough: men and women having safe, platonic relationships that don't become romantic and are just genuine, almost sibling-like relationships."</p><p>We can't wait to see how it plays out in season 2. Unfortunately, as of this writing, Netflix hasn't confirmed a renewal yet.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddnsBuw8SdpZ6rlJbGtHnJnqWnmV2kv7WxxppknZmknruoec2ormg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
