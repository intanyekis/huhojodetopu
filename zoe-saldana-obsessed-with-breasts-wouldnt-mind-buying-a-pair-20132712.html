There's no question that <a href=#><strong>Zoe Saldana</strong></a> has a gorgeous figure. With her long legs and slender waist, she looks just as great in jeans and a T-shirt as she does in slinky red-carpet gowns. But in a new interview for <a href=#>Lucky</a> magazine's February issue, on sale Jan. 1, she admits there are at least a couple of things she "wouldn't mind" changing — namely, her breasts.</p><p>"You always want what you don't have. My whole life I've been obsessed with breasts," the 35-year-old Star Trek Into Darkness actress says. "I love them. I don't like fake things, but I wouldn't mind buying myself a pair one day before I die."</p><p>That said, she doesn't think a woman's bra size should be her defining characteristic. "When I hear men saying, 'I don't want droopy breasts,' I think, 'I'm sorry, you're not really a man.' A man likes a woman as she is," the star tells Lucky. "You know when you meet a real man from the way he talks about a woman. You just go, 'Wow, you're a man.'"</p><p>Saldana declined to talk with the mag about her own man — she secretly married Italian artist <strong>Marco Perego</strong> in London this summer — but she did open up about her personal sense of style, and how she feels when people criticize an outfit or look.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"I can give two s–ts about what somebody thought I looked like. At the moment I conceived wearing an outfit, I had a thousand reasons," she says. "And now that it's done, and I'm getting feedback that's not positive, I'm going to regret it? I take responsibility for my actions, whether the outcome is positive or negative."</p><p>Her fashion choices reflect who she is as a person, she adds. "I like looking strong. I don't need someone to open the door for me. I can open a jar!" the Avatar beauty explains. "For some reason, dressing very delicately brings out a fragility that compels people to help you and I don't like it."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58r7HWrGazp5ViwKK4w5qlmmWfl8Cmv9Kem2avmam1bq7RnpisrKNixLDBy52lrWWdnrulecGusKKml2KubrzAoqlmamBmgHODkGtm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 BlogLab - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
